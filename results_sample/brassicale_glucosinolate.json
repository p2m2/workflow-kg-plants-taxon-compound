Yet, genomic-based study of the B. napus GSL regulatory mechanisms are scarce due to the complexity of working with polyploid species. To address these challenges, we used transcriptome-based GWAS approach, Associative Transcriptomics (AT), across a diversity panel of 288 B. napus genotypes to uncover the underlying genetic basis controlling quantitative variation of GSLs in B. napus vegetative tissues. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers and gene expression markers (GEMs) associations identify orthologues of MYB28/HAG1 (AT5G61420), specifically the copies on chromosome A9 and C2, to be the key regulators of aliphatic GSL variation in leaves. We show that the positive correlation observed between aliphatic GSLs in seed and leaf is due to the amount synthesized, as controlled by Bna.HAG1.A9 and Bna.HAG1.C2, rather than by variation in the transport processes. In addition, AT and differential expression analysis in root tissues implicate an orthologue of MYB29/HAG3 (AT5G07690), Bna.HAG3.A3, as controlling root aromatic GSL variation. Based on the root expression data we also propose Bna.MAM3.A3 to have a role in controlling phenylalanine chain elongation for aromatic GSL biosynthesis. This work uncovers a regulator of homophenylalanine-derived aromatic GSLs and implicates the shared biosynthetic pathways between aliphatic and aromatic GSLs.", "intro": "IntroductionGlucosinolates (GSLs) are a group of sulfur- and nitrogen-rich secondary metabolites prevalent in Brassicales. GSLs are economically significant because their bioactive hydrolysates have diverse biological properties that impact agriculturally important Brassica crops such as oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) and have been studied extensively in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Depending on the reaction conditions and GSL side-chain structure, bioactive hydrolysates such as isothiocyanates, nitriles and oxazolidine-2-thione are produced when myrosinase enzymes came into contact with GSLs after tissue damage. Some GSLs and their hydrolysis products are thought to defend the plants against non-adapted pathogen and insect pests, while other isothiocyanates are suitable as biofumigants to control soil pests and weeds. However, other GSLs have negative impacts. For example, progoitrin can accumulate to high concentrations in seeds. When these are hydrolyzed, it produces goitrogenic products that reduce the nutritional values of the protein-rich seed meal used as livestock feed. To allow the use of seed meal as animal feed, extensive breeding efforts have been made to select for oilseed rape cultivars with low seed GSLs (<30 mumol/g). On the other hand, the introduction of '00' (low seed erucic and GSL) cultivars, has led to the concern that these cultivars could be more susceptible to pests and diseases due to reduction of the presumed defensive role of GSL. Nevertheless, levels of GSLs and their interaction with plant pests may be more intricate than previously thought because the same GSL profile can acts as both deterrent to generalist pests and stimulant to specialist pests. Some studies have reported no significant correlation of GSL between seeds and leaves, suggesting that modifying the GSL profiles selectively in different parts of the plant may be feasible. However, the underlying genetic control of quantitative variations of GSL in vegetative tissues and seeds of B. napus, and their interaction, are not well understood.Based on their amino acid precursor of the side chain, GSLs are divided into three structural groups: aliphatic, indole and aromatic GSLs, which derived from methionine, tryptophan and phenylalanine respectively. The biosynthetic pathway of GSLs proceeds in three stages via (i) amino acid side chain elongation; (ii) the amino acid moiety undergoing metabolic configurations to form the core GSL structure; and (iii) secondary modifications of the side chain to generate a wide spectrum of GSL compounds (Fig. 1). Many of the genes responsible for biosynthetic steps have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana (reviewed in), which has also helped clarify the core biosynthesis steps and identify orthologous genes in the closely related Brassica species. A group of R2R3 MYB transcription factors from a single gene family within Arabidopsis is known to be involved in the direct transcriptional regulation of GSLs biosynthesis. MYB34/ATR1, MYB51/HIG1, and MYB122/HIG2 are thought to regulate the tryptophan-derived indole GSL pathway, and MYB28/HAG1, MYB29/HAG3 and MYB76/HAG2 regulate the methionine-derived aliphatic GSL biosynthetic genes. Since methionine-derived aliphatic and tryptophan-derived indole GSLs are the two main classes of GSLs found in A. thaliana, significant progress has been made in understanding the biochemistry and the regulatory controls of these two classes of GSLs. However, less information is available for the chain-elongated homophenylalanine-derived aromatic GSL, which is abundant in Brassica species. So far, the genes involved in the side chain elongation and the regulatory genes controlling aromatic GSL biosynthesis remain largely uncharacterized. Furthermore, the CYP79A2 that catalyzes phenylalanine substrates has been shown unable to metabolize homophenylalanine into aldoxime, suggesting the enzyme that controls the flux into the biosynthetic pathway of homophenylalanine-derived aromatic GSLs in B. napus is yet to be identified.While some of the natural variation in GSL profiles can be explained by allelic variation of key biosynthetic genes, other differences are likely to be caused by the activity of regulatory loci. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) provides a powerful method of using genetically diverse population to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) at higher resolution by exploiting historical recombination between molecular markers and loci associated with trait variation. With the focus on seed quality traits, association studies had been effectively applied to identify clusters of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) highly associated with seed GSL content in B. napus in recent years. Nevertheless, to get better understanding of the modular genetic system that regulates GSL natural variations in B. napus as a whole, more work is needed to investigate the regulations of GSL in the vegetative tissues and how these variations relate to the GSL profiles in the seed.In this study we aimed to elucidate the genetic control of GSL biosynthesis in leaves and roots of B. napus. We took the approach of firstly undertaking a transcriptome-based GWAS approach. Such a genomics approach was feasible because of the availability of the recently-established full-scale Associative Transcriptomics (AT) platform comprising 355,536 SNP markers and transcriptome reference comprising 116,098 ordered coding DNA sequence gene models. We could deploy this for a large panel of 288 B. napus accessions because of the availability of a recently-developed simple and efficient GSL extraction method.", "results": "ResultsGlucosinolates identified in B. napus leaves and rootsA subset of 288 diverse B. napus accessions with defined crop types of the RIPR panel (Renewable Industrial Products from Rapeseed) was analyzed for GSL compositions in the leaves and roots of 4-week old plants. Fourteen different GSLs were identified. Out of these, nine are classed as aliphatic (including C3, C4 and C5 types), four indole and one aromatic GSL (Table 1). Detailed profiles are provided in Appendix 1 of. To identify relationships between GSL content of leaves and roots, we performed a Spearman's correlation analysis (Table 2). Within leaf, the total amount of GSL accumulated in the tissue is determined largely by the level of leaf aliphatic GSL (r = 0.91 ***). While both indole and aromatic GSLs are the major GSL classes found in roots, aromatic GSL (i.e. GST) provides a much stronger indication of the total amount of root GSLs (r = 0.75 ***) than root indole GSL (r = 0.41 ***). Significant positive correlations were observed between aliphatic and aromatic GSLs within the same tissue (Leaf: r = 0.62 ***, Root: r = 0.30 ***), as well as between leaf and root (r = 0.50 ***, 0.29 ***), suggest the possibility of co-regulation that is shared between these two classes of GSLs. Whereas, the weak and negative correlations between indole and aromatic GSL within root (r = -0.18 **) and between root and leaf tissues (r = -0.15*, -0.22***) indicate antagonistic relationship between this two GSL classes. Given that different GSL profiles were found between aliphatic-dominated leaf and indole/aromatic-dominated root (Fig. 2), the GSL metabolic pathways between above- and below- ground tissues appears to be regulated differentially yet has some cross-talk between the pathways, which is supported by the weak but significant correlation between total GSLs in the leaf and root (r = 0.28 ***).Genetic control of leaf glucosinolate variationExtensive phenotypic variation was observed in leaves for both amount and type of GSLs. The total GSL content ranged from 0.26 to 21.6 mumol/g in leaves, with aliphatic GSLs as the predominant class (64.0% of all leaf GSLs), indole GSLs contributing (32.9%) and a small amount of the aromatic GSL, GST (3.1%). When the B. napus diversity panel was assessed by crop type, accessions of the swede crop type were found to contain the greatest amount of GSL (Appendix 3 in), with modern winter and spring oilseed rape crop types having the lowest GSL content.To understand the genetic control of this observed variation we used the established B. napus Associative Transcriptomics (AT) platform consisting of 355,536 SNP markers and gene expression matrix with a transcriptome reference of 116,098 ordered coding DNA sequence gene models to identify molecular marker variation associated with trait variation. As visualized using \"Manhattan Plots\", clusters of markers with allelic variation correlated with trait variation indicates regions of the genome containing genes controlling the traits. We undertook AT analysis on all individual GSLs, total GSL and GSLs grouped by type (aliphatic, indole or aromatic). The Manhattan plots are shown in Appendix 5 of. As illustrated in Fig. 3, associations for aliphatic GSL content exceeding the Bonferroni-corrected 5% significance threshold with SNP markers were observed in regions of chromosomes A2, A9, C2 and C9. A fifth region exceeding the 5% FDR threshold (but not the Bonferroni-corrected 5% significance threshold) was identified on chromosome C7. These five genomic regions had previously been observed in an AT analysis of total seed GSL content, suggesting that leaf and seed GSL content are both controlled by the same loci. Investigation of the genes underlying the positions of these five association peaks, as shown in Appendix 9 of, revealed at every one an orthologue of HAG1 (AT5G61420), a transcription factor that positively regulated aliphatic GSL biosynthesis. In addition, of the associations between Gene Expression Markers (GEM) and leaf aliphatic GSL content that exceeding the 5% FDR threshold six were detected for genes involved directly in aliphatic GSL biosynthesis (Appendix 11 in). Two of these genes are known to be involved in the aliphatic amino acid chain elongation, an orthologue of AT5G23020, a methythioalkymalate synthase (MAM3) was found on A3 and an orthologue of AT5G23010, MAM1, on C7. Two genes involved in the core GSL structure biosynthesis, an orthologue of AT1G16410, a cytochrome P450 CYP79F1 and an orthologue of AT1G78370, a glutathione S-transferase TAU 20 (GSTU20) were identified on chromosome C5 and A7 respectively. Two orthologues of HAG1, Bna.HAG1.A9 and Bna.HAG1.C2, were also identified amongst the top GEMs, implicating the transcript abundance levels of these genes in the control of aliphatic GSL in the leaf. To test this, we analyzed leaf transcript abundance on four biological replicates for all six HAG1 orthologues in 5 high leaf GSL and 4 low leaf GSL B. napus accessions. Consistent with the AT results, as shown in Fig. 4, expression of Bna.HAG1.A9 and Bna.HAG1.C2 showed strong positive correlation with level of aliphatic GSL in leaves, whereas the orthologues on A3, C7 and C9 were expressed at relatively low levels. The remaining orthologue, on chromosome A2 was relatively highly expressed in all accessions so this copy appears to be either encode a non-functional protein or has lost its role in the control of leaf glucosinolate biosynthesis by subfunctionalization.Genetic control of root glucosinolate variationExtensive phenotypic variation was observed in roots for both amount and type of GSLs. The total GSL content in roots ranged from 2.4 to 17.1 mumol/g (Appendix 1 in). In contrast to leaves, indole GSLs (47.7%) and the aromatic GSL GST (45.0%) formed the major classes, with aliphatic GSLs being a minor component (7.3%).To identify loci controlling the level and composition of GSLs in roots, we undertook AT analysis on all individual GSLs, total GSL and GSLs grouped by type (aliphatic, indole or aromatic). The Manhattan plots are shown in Appendix 4 of. For the root aliphatic GSLs, SNP associations revealed the same controlling loci on A2/C2 and A9/C9 as in leaves, and furthermore Bna.HAG1.A9 is also identified as one of the top GEMs (p =  2.10x10-9). For the aromatic GSL (i.e. GST), an exceptionally well-defined association peak, with SNP markers exceeding the Bonferroni-corrected 5% significance threshold, was identified on chromosome A3, as shown in Fig. 5. The genes in this region as listed in Appendix 14 of include an orthologue of HAG3 (AT5G07690), a transcription factor shown (from studies in A. thaliana) to regulate aliphatic GSL biosynthesis. The expression level of Bna.HAG3.A3 in the AT platform dataset of is low across all accessions. The functional genotypes had been derived from re-sequencing of leaf transcriptome, so GEMs would not be identifiable for genes with root-specific expression patterns. We therefore performed differential expression analyses based on root transcriptome re-sequencing of 4 accessions with high root aromatic GSLs and 4 accessions with low root aromatic GSLs, as listed in Appendix 15 of, each with 4 biological replicates. Bna.HAG3.A3 expression was found to be highly correlated with aromatic GSL content (log2 fold-change = 14.8; p = 5.47 x 10-11) with expression of Bna.HAG3.A3 high in high-root aromatic GSL group and very low in the low-root aromatic group, as shown in Supplementary Figure S1, confirming Bna.HAG3.A3 as an excellent candidate for controlling this trait.In order to identify differential expression of genes that might be regulated by Bna.HAG3.A3 in such a way as to limit potential confounding effect between GSL pathways, we performed a stringent root differential expression analysis (log2 fold-change >= 4; p <= 1 x 10-10) between accessions N01D-1330 and KARAT, which differ in root aromatic GSLs but both of which are low in aliphatic GSLs. This analysis revealed 107 genes with BLAST hits to annotated A. thaliana genes, including an orthologue of MAM3 (AT5G23020) on chromosome A3, an orthologue of IMPI2 (AT2G43100) on chromosome C4 and orthologues of CYP83A1 (AT4G13770) on each of chromosomes A4 and C4, as shown in Appendix 16 of. All of these show higher expression in the high root aromatic GSL accession. In Arabidopsis, MAM3 was identified as the key enzyme catalyzing chain elongation of methionine-derived GSLs and CYP83A1 can oxidize both aliphatic and aromatic aldoximes. In B. napus, we found that the expression of Bna.MAM3.A3, Bna.CYP83A1.A4 and Bna.CYP83A1.C4 all had significant positive correlations with aromatic GSL in roots (Appendix 17 in). GST is a derivative of the chain-elongated homophenylalanine but the genes involved in the chain-elongation of phenylalanine of aromatic GSL pathway are unclear. This result suggests that Bna.MAM3.A3 may play an important role in phenylalanine elongation for aromatic GSL biosynthesis in B. napus.Relationships between glucosinolate content of vegetative tissues and seedsIn order to understand the relationship of GSLs between vegetative tissues and seeds, we added the seed GSL data from to the leaf and root data collected from this study and extended the Spearman's correlation analysis shown in Table 2 to include seeds. Aliphatic GSL exhibited the strongest correlations between organs, in particular between leaf and the other two organs (Leaf-Root: r = 0.68 ***, Leaf-Seed: 0.54 ***, Seed-Root: 0.43 ***). These significant positive correlations indicate that natural variation observed in aliphatic GSL between the organs could be regulated by long-distance transport or a master regulator of the aliphatic biosynthetic pathway that controls the biosynthesis of aliphatic GSLs in all of these organs. To investigate whether variation in transport or biosynthesis processes explained the natural variations in aliphatic GSL pattern between leaf and seed B. napus, we analyzed additional seed data for associations with the orthologues of Arabidopsis GSL transporters, GTR1 (AT3G47960) and GTR2 (AT5G62680). In B. napus genome, four orthologues of GTR1 (on C3 and A6) and five orthologues of GTR2 (on C3, C9, A6 and A9) were found but none of the copies showed associations with seed, leaf or root aliphatic GSL. Although Bna.GTR2.A9 and Bna.GTR2.C9 were found in parts of the genome within the SNP and GEM association peaks on chromosome A9 and C9, no correlation between gene expressions and aliphatic contents was observed across the tissues (Appendix 18 in). Comparison of the AT plots for total seed GSL, leaf aliphatic and root aliphatic GSLs showed that they all shared four common association peaks on chromosome A2, A9, C2 and C9 which correspond to the HAG1 orthologue-containing control loci. Furthermore, comparison of aliphatic GSLs in leaf and seed, as shown in Supplementary Figure S2 revealed two distinct classes: one with relatively high GSL in both organs and one with relatively low GSL in both organs. The lack of any accession with high GSL in the leaves and low GSL in the seeds indicates the basis of aliphatic GSL variations between plant tissues to be from the amount synthesized, as controlled by orthologues of HAG1, and not by variation in the transport processes."}, "37894683": {"doi": "10.3390/molecules28207203", "title": "Selenium Biofortification Effect on Glucosinolate Content of Brassica oleracea var. italic and Eruca vesicaria", "abstract": "Glucosinolates (GSLs) in different plant parts of broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italic) and rocket (Eruca vesicaria) were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively before and after treatment with sodium selenate (2 and 5 mM), by their desulfo-counterparts using the UHPLC-DAD-MS/MS technique. Twelve GSLs were detected in broccoli (five aliphatic, one arylaliphatic, and six indolic), where 4-(methylsulfanyl)butyl GSL (glucoerucin) was the main one in the roots (4.88-9.89 micromol/g DW), 4-(methylsulfinyl)butyl GSL (glucoraphanin) in stems (0.44-1.11 micromol/g DW), and 4-hydroxyindol-3-ylmethyl GSL (4-hydroxyglucobrassicin) in leaves (0.51-0.60 micromol/g DW). No GSL containing selenium was detected in the treated broccoli. Ten GSLs were detected in rocket (seven aliphatic and three indolic), where 4-(methylsulfanyl)butyl GSL (glucoerucin) was the main one in the roots (4.50-20.59 micromol/g DW) and 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl GSL (4-methoxyglucobrassicin) in the aerial part (0.57-5.69 micromol/g DW). As a result of induced stress by selenium fertilization, the total GSL content generally increased in both plants. In contrast to broccoli, the roots and the aerial part of the rocket treated with a high concentration of sodium selenate contained 4-(methylseleno)butyl GSL (glucoselenoerucin) (0.36-4.48 micromol/g DW). Although methionine-derived GSLs are the most abundant in both plants, the plants' ability to tolerate selenate and its regulation by selenoglucosinolate production is species- and growth-stage-dependent. ", "intro": "1. IntroductionSelenium (Se) is an important micronutrient required by most living organisms. The difference between deficiency and toxicity is incredibly narrow compared to other micronutrients, with toxic dosages of >400 mug/day and a dietary deficiency of 40 mug/day, which is an emerging global problem. Plants are important sources of organic Se, as they have the capacity to accumulate inorganic Se or metabolites and store them as organic Se forms. Selenates (SeO42-) and selenites (SeO32-) are the most significant inorganic forms of Se that are easily taken by plants. Selenate is the most common and fastest-assimilating form of bioavailable Se in alkaline soils with high oxygen content, whereas selenite is more prevalent in anoxic settings with higher acidity and humidity. Plants usually intake selenate, which is reduced, incorporated into organic compounds (selenomethionine, selenocysteine) and further transported through the food chain, and finally decomposed and excreted from the organism, thus completing the biogeochemical cycle of Se. Se levels in soil generally reflect its presence in foods and, therefore, its availability to humans. With an estimated mean Se content in human soft tissues of 110 mug/kg, it was found that the Se intake status in Europe was low, which means that the Se levels in European soils are not sufficient. Therefore, biofortification is an important strategy to increase Se in the edible parts of plants.Based on their ability to accumulate Se, plants can be categorized into three main groups: non-accumulators (accumulate less than 100 mg Se/kg dry weight, DW), secondary accumulators or accumulators (accumulate up to 1000 mg Se/kg DW), and hyperaccumulators (accumulate over 1000 mg Se/kg DW). The ability to hyperaccumulate Se appears to have evolved within the Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, and Fabaceae families. Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) and rocket (Eruca vesicaria) are members of Brassicaceae family, which is the largest family in the order Brassicales. Some known Se secondary accumulators include several plants of the Brassica genus, such as Brassica juncea, Brassica napus, and Brassica oleracea var. italic, whereas Se-hyperaccumulators include plants of the Cardamine genus (Cardamine hupingshanensis, Cardamine violofolia) and Stanleya genus (Stanleya pinnata, Stanleya bipinnata). Glucosinolates (GSLs) are well-defined specialized plant metabolites containing sulfur and nitrogen which represent the molecular tags of plants from the Brassicaceae family. Generally, they are found in 16 families of the order Brassicales, as well as several plants outside of this order, such as the genus Drypetes (family Putranjivaceae, order Malpighiales) and Rinorea genus (family Violaceae, order Malpighiales). GSLs can be divided into three classes based on the structure of various amino acid precursors: aliphatic GSLs derived from methionine, isoleucine, leucine, or valine; arylaliphatic GSLs derived from phenylalanine or tyrosine; and indole GSLs derived from tryptophan. Only 90 of the 139 GSLs discovered in the plant kingdom have been thoroughly described by relevant spectroscopy techniques (MS, NMR) to date. Se-biofortification influences GSL production with possible exchange positions of sulfur (S) by selenium (Se) in three places in the side chain, in thioglucose, and in the sulfate group (Figure 1). Several crop species have been biofortified with Se in field or greenhouse experiments where various Se sources and techniques were used. According to Stewart et al. (1974), sinigrin, which was isolated from horseradish (Armoracia rusticana) after receiving Na275SeO4, was shown to contain Se in its structure. After three weeks at high Se concentrations (100 ppm) in water-cultured specimens of the Se-tolerant species desert princes' plume (Stanleya pinnata), Bertelsen et al. (1988) detected trace quantities of GSL containing Se named as but-3-enylselenoglucosinolate, whereas those grown in environments with lower, more typical Se amounts did not contain this compound. Additionally, no such selenoglucosinolates were found in garden cress (Lepidium sativum) and horseradish (Armoracia rusticana). This selenoglucosinolate, originally defined as a compound in which the Se atom is replaced by an S atom in the anomeric position in the GSL structure, is converted into isoselenocyanates by enzymatic hydrolysis. Since the formation of isoselenocyanates rather than isothiocyanates significantly departs from the characteristics of GSLs, they are, by definition, not GSLs (Figure 1).Matich et al. (2012) treated broccoli (B. oleracea var. italica), cauliflower (B. oleracea L.), and forage rape (B. napus) with elevated sodium selenate and examined them for the presence of organoselenides. Based on the analysis of broccoli and cauliflower florets, and the roots of forage rape, the discovery of putative GSL hydrolysis products using synthesized standards confirmed by MS and NMR, as well as by LC-MS analysis, three Se-Met artificially derived GSLs of the general type (methylseleno)alkyl GSL are accepted: 3-(methylseleno)propyl GSL (glucoselenoibervirin [144]), 4-(methylseleno)butyl GSL (glucoselenoerucin, [145]), and 5-(methylseleno)pentyl GSL (glucoselenoberteroin, [146]). This analysis showed that Se is preferentially incorporated into the methylselenyl moiety rather than the sulfate or beta-thioglucose groups. A further Se-biofortification study by Matich et al. (2015) using HPLC-MS/MS tentatively indicated glucoselenoraphanin in broccoli (B. oleracea var. italica) florets with Se envisioned in the side chain and glucoselenonasturtiin in forage rape (B. napus) roots, but with Se, that could not be envisioned to be on the side chain, suggesting a selenoGSL sensu Bertelsen et al.. Black mustard (Brassica nigra) seeds grown on naturally Se-rich soils in the Punjab region of India, where the Se soil content ranges from 2 to 7 mg/kg, were studied by Ouerdane et al. (2013). Using HPLC ESI Orbitrap MS(/MS) and GC APCI TQ MS/MS for the extract analysis, among over 30 Se species, they detected the presence of \"selenoglucosinolates\", namely glucoselenoibervirin and glucoselenoerucin, as well as their corresponding degradation products 3-(methylseleno)propylisothiocyanate and 4-(methylseleno)butanenitrile, i.e., 4-(methylseleno)butylisothiocyanate and 5-(methylseleno)pentanenitrile, respectively. To avoid confusion with selenoglucosinolates according to Bertelsen et al., GSLs with Se in the side chain are suggested to be referred to as selenoMet-derived GSLs. The presence of Se in the side chains is fully compatible with the definition of GSLs because they form isothiocyanates and not isoselenocyanates as hydrolysis products (Figure 1). The effects of Se-fertilization on GSL production in a radish (Raphanus sativus) have been studied by McKenzie et al. (2019) throughout a period of five developmental phases (from seed to fully developed salad greens). With the double bond geometry still unclear, they used tandem mass spectrometry to determine the existence of a novel Se-containing GSL, 4-(methylseleno)but-3-enyl GSL (also named selenoglucoraphenin). By using GC-MS, two similar isothiocyanates of 4-(methylseleno)but-3-enyl isothiocyanate were tentatively identified as (E/Z?) isomers. Se-biofertilization of mature radish led to the presence of selenoglucosinolates in the seed. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of Se intake and its metabolism, with special emphasis on the identification and quantification of GSLs and selenoMet-derived GSLs. For this purpose, cultivated broccoli (Brassica olaracea var. italic) and rocket (Eruca vesicaria) were watered with sodium selenate salt solutions (Na2SeO4) of different concentrations for 35 days and GSLs were analyzed by UHPLC-DAD-MS/MS according to the ISO 9167-1 official method. ", "results": "2. Results and Discussion2.1. Effect of Selenium Treatment on Broccoli Brassica oleracea var. italica, a young plant which, after 18 days, had no developed flowers or florets, was exposed to Na2SeO4 concentrations of 2 mM and 5 mM over a period of 35 days. During that time period, the plants did not exhibit any signs of decay of the existing plant parts throughout cultivation. The detrimental influence of selenate solution on the aerial part's growth was notable when compared to the reference plant's height, which was 33 cm, and in comparison to 25 cm of the plant exposed to 5 mM selenate solution (Figure S1, Table S1). Se-biofertilization had a detrimental effect on root growth, as evidenced by the fact that the reference plant's measured roots were 24 cm long compared to 6 cm length of roots watered with the highest Na2SeO4 concentration (Figure S1, Table S1). The symptom of Se exposure is a reduction in root elongation. Selenate treatment was shown to decrease cytokinin oxidase transcript levels. Cytokinin oxidases in Arabidopsis are known to catalyze the irreversible degradation of the hormone cytokinin, in which accumulation in the root tips may partly be responsible for the root meristem shortening. A previous report by Adamopoulou et al. included the study of Se toxicity on broccoli florets grown hydroponically in a greenhouse for 12 weeks. The plants were fortified with two different concentrations of sodium selenate (1.5 mM and 3.0 mM) between the 5th and 10th week. Although broccoli florets grown in the presence and absence of sulfur had the same weight, the absence of sulfur also led to increased Se toxicity, which reduced weight by up to 65%. Also, the leaves' optical characteristics revealed no visible signs of the biofortification. Tian et al. reported the influence of selenium treatment on broccoli growth and showed that when S nutrition was low, Se was particularly harmful to plants and dramatically reduced plant sizes. They proposed that the Se toxicity could be counteracted by increasing sulfate supplementation, which would likely occur via the decreasing non-specific integration of Se into proteins and altering the redox system.GSLs were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed via desulfated forms using UHPLC-DAD-MS/MS, and the results are presented in Table 1 and Figure 2, as well as in the Supplementary Materials (Figures S3-S6).Five Met-derived desulfoGSLs (dGSLs) with sulfur in the side chain, one Phe-derived dGSL, and six Trp-derived dGSLs were identified. Based on the obtained [M+Na]+, no GSLs with Se in the structure were detected. At tR = 8.30 min, [M + Na]+ = 437 was observed, which was assumed to be a hitherto unidentified dGSL, and was labeled [X]. The UV spectrum of dGSL indicated that it is an indole GSL, and the MS2 spectrum was recorded in order to identify the characteristic fragments (Figure S6). Fragments m/z 185 (\"a\", Na+ adduct of C6H10O5) and m/z 274 (\"c\", loss of C6H10O5) are observed, which suggested that it is a GSL. The fragment m/z 389 indicated the loss of the methoxy and hydroxyl groups. Based on this information, hydroxymethoxyglucobrassicin was proposed, since it is known that hydroxylation and the subsequent methylation of the indole ring takes place at positions 1 and 4 (R1 and R2, respectively, Figure 2). Namely, the key enzymes are cytochrome P450 monooxygenases of the CYP81F subfamily, which carry out hydroxylation reactions at position 4 or 1 of the indole ring. IGMT enzymes, which belong to the family of plant O-methyltransferases, convert hydroxy intermediates into methoxylated products, and the enzyme IGMT5 specific for position 1 of the indole ring was found, i.e., IGMT1-4 enzymes specific for position 4. The aliphatic and indole GSL type represent the major GSL found in the analyzed plant parts, with the roots having the highest GSL content. The total content of GSLs in the roots increased for both solution concentrations added (2 mM and 5 mM) when compared to the control and differed significantly (p <= 0.05). Glucoerucin (84), as the main GSL in roots, significantly increased from 4.88 micromol/g DW to 9.05 and 9.89 micromol/g DW, respectively. Several studies have reported the existence of Se-GSLs in certain plant parts, such as florets and roots, after the Se-biofertilization of GSL-containing plants. Matich et al. (2012, 2015) showed the presence of Se-GSLs in biofortified broccoli florets. However, the same plant in our study did not reach this stage of development (no florets) and no Se-GSLs were detected. According to Tian et al., the total GSL contents of broccoli sprouts determined by glucose from GSL hydrolysis were not significantly changed by the impacts of Se treatments (100 micromol/L selenite and selenate). However, since the analysis was not conducted in accordance with the ISO 9167 standard method, this should only be accepted cautiously.2.2. Effect of Selenium Treatment on Rocket Eruca vesicaria (rocket), a 24-day old plant, was also exposed to Na2SeO4 concentrations of 2 mM and 5 mM over a period of 35 days. A similar detrimental influence of Se-biofortification on morphological characteristics was observed for rocket as in broccoli. When sodium selenate (5 mM) was applied, the plant's height decreased from ca. 23 cm to 8 cm and its root length from ca. 15 cm to 10 cm. In this case, the aerial part biomass decreased, and the beginning of decay was observed for the highest concentration (Figure S2, Table S2).GSLs were qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed via desulfated forms using UHPLC-DAD-MS/MS, and the results are presented in Table 2 and Figure 3 and Figure 4, as well as in the Supplementary Materials (Figures S7-S12).Six methionine-derived GSLs and three indole ones were identified in the rocket. By comparing the chromatograms obtained for the root and aerial component, it was discovered that Se-treated samples exhibit a signal that is not present in the reference plant, particularly in the root. Its [M+Na]+ was 412 at tR = 7.6 min, which did not correspond to previously known GSL of that mass. It was assumed that it is selenomethionine-derived selenoglucosinolate, namely glucoselenoerucin ([145]), whose desulfo form structure is given in Figure 4, since the obtained mass corresponds to this dGSL when sulfur is replaced by selenium.In the MS2 spectrum, fragments marked \"a\", \"b\", \"c\", and \"d\" are present, indicating that Se was not found in the thioglucose part, but in the side chain derived from selenomethionine (Se-Met). Right next to 412, 410 appears, which is assumed to be the isotope of selenium 78, so MS2 was obtained for this [M + Na]+ and fragment m/z 185 (a) was also observed (Figure S12). According to previous literature, this selenoglucosinolate was identified for the first time through its desulfated form and its MS2 was shown for the first time.The total GSL content is related mostly to the content of aliphatic GSLs, with the highest found in the roots. The occurrence of this GSL derived from Se-Met can be related to the high content of its sulfur analogue glucoerucin (84), and the highest content was obtained in the roots of the plant treated with 2 mM solution, 4.48 micromol/g DW. With the addition of 5 mM sodium solution, rocket showed the signs of decay and the total GSL content decreased, having 14.21 and 2.47 micromol/g DW in the roots and aerial parts, in comparison to the control having 32.34 and 13.24 micromol/g DW, respectively, and differed significantly (p <= 0.05). Consequently, the content of GSL [145] decreased. Dall'Acqua et al. studied the Se-biofortification of two rocket species (Eruca sativa = E. vesicaria and Diplotaxis tenuifolia) grown at 0-40 microM Na2SeO4 in hydroponics and also showed a GSL decrease. Contrary to our investigation, selenoglucosinolates have not been reported in these species. Also, they showed that selenium treatment reduced cysteine and methionine content, and glutathione (GSH), whose precursor is cysteine, also showed a trend toward reduction; thus, a decrease in GSLs, also observed in this study, may be explained by the negative effects of selenate on aminoacids biosynthesis, during which selenoamino acids can be formed and be incorporated into proteins and/or form selenoGSLs."}, "36759657": {"doi": "10.1038/s41598-023-28661-6", "title": "Reduced glucosinolate content in oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) by random mutagenesis of BnMYB28 and BnCYP79F1 genes", "abstract": "The presence of anti-nutritive compounds like glucosinolates (GSLs) in the rapeseed meal severely restricts its utilization as animal feed. Therefore, reducing the GSL content to < 18 micromol/g dry weight in the seeds is a major breeding target. While candidate genes involved in the biosynthesis of GSLs have been described in rapeseed, comprehensive functional analyses are missing. By knocking out the aliphatic GSL biosynthesis genes BnMYB28 and BnCYP79F1 encoding an R2R3 MYB transcription factor and a cytochrome P450 enzyme, respectively, we aimed to reduce the seed GSL content in rapeseed. After expression analyses on single paralogs, we used an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) treated population of the inbred winter rapeseed 'Express617' to detect functional mutations in the two gene families. Our results provide the first functional analysis by knock-out for the two GSL biosynthesis genes in winter rapeseed. We demonstrate that independent knock-out mutants of the two genes possessed significantly reduced seed aliphatic GSLs, primarily progoitrin. Compared to the wildtype Express617 control plants (36.3 micromol/g DW), progoitrin levels were decreased by 55.3% and 32.4% in functional mutants of BnMYB28 (16.20 micromol/g DW) and BnCYP79F1 (24.5 micromol/g DW), respectively. Our study provides a strong basis for breeding rapeseed with improved meal quality in the future.", "intro": "IntroductionOilseed rape or rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is an essential oil crop, ranking as the third-largest source of vegetable oil globally (http://www.fao.org/faostat/). In Europe, it is grown as a winter crop, sown in autumn and flowering in the following spring after exposure to cold temperatures over winter. The seeds contain 45-50% oil with a healthy lipid profile, suitable for human consumption. Moreover, it is utilized for biodiesel production. After oil extraction, the rapeseed meal (RSM) serves as a protein-rich (40%) animal feed. However, major anti-nutritive compounds like glucosinolates (GSLs) in RSM adversely affect its nutritional and commercial value. Therefore, increasing yield potential, seed oil content, and improving seed meal quality are major goals for rapeseed breeding.GSLs are diverse heterogeneous secondary metabolites specific to Brassicales. They are sulfur and nitrogen-containing products derived from glucose and amino acids as precursors, comprising a thioglucose and a sulfonated oxime attached to the chain elongated amino acid. Depending on their respective amino acid precursors, GSLs are categorized as aliphatic, aromatic, and indolic, originating primarily from methionine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan, respectively. Biosynthesis of the three types is independently controlled by distinct gene families. Roughly 130 different GSL types have been described from 16 dicot angiosperms, most of which are edible plants. Apart from B. napus, B. oleracea (cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and kale), and B. rapa (turnips and radish) are economically relevant vegetables rich in GSLs. Fifteen major GSL types have been identified in B. napus, reaching levels as high as 60-100 micromol/g dry weight in seeds with the methionine-derived aliphatic GSLs constituting up to 92% of all GSL types. The development of rapeseed varieties with low GSL seed content was a milestone in rapeseed breeding. Alleles conferring low seed GSL content were introgressed from the Polish spring variety 'Bronowski' to develop modern rapeseed cultivars with improved seed meal traits. In modern varieties, the GSL content of the RSM has been reduced to 8-15 mumol per gram seed weight.GSL biosynthesis is completed in three major steps, (i) chain elongation, (ii) core structure formation, and (iii) secondary side-chain modifications. First, the addition of methylene groups results in chain elongated amino acids. Next, the addition of the sulfur group to the chain-elongated amino acids and S-glucosylation completes the core structure formation. Lastly, secondary modifications like benzoylation, desaturation, hydroxylation, methoxylation, and oxidation result in distinct GSL types. Environmental effects combined with specific genetic mechanisms for GSL biosynthesis, regulation, transport, and storage result in varying GSL contents and diverse profiles observed across Brassica species.GSLs yield toxic by-products after enzymatic cleavage by the endogenous thioglucoside glucohydrolase called myrosinase. Upon physical injury, the myrosinase is released from so-called 'myrosin cells' and comes into contact with GSLs stored in 'S-cells'. Hydrolysis of GSLs generates various products like isothiocyanates (ITC), thiocyanates (SCN), epithionitriles, and nitriles (NI), many of which are known to confer defense against generalist herbivores and bacterial and fungal pathogens. GSLs have been shown to confer antimicrobial properties against the phytopathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris and the necrotrophic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. High consumption of GSLs through the feed can result in several adverse metabolic effects in animals. Hydroxyalkenyl GSLs like epiprogoitrin and progoitrin are goitrogenic by causing inflammation of the thyroid gland. Retarded growth, reduced appetite, and feed efficiency, gastrointestinal irritation, liver and kidney damage, and behavioral effects have been observed in fish, poultry, and higher mammals like pigs. On the contrary, other GSL types like sulforaphane and indole-3-carbinol are known for their beneficial effects on human health with anti-carcinogenic properties.A complex network of transcription factors (TFs) influenced by abiotic and biotic stimuli, hormonal and epigenetic factors controls the spatiotemporal regulation of GSL biosynthesis. The most notable genes controlling aliphatic GSL biosynthesis in Arabidopsis are R2R3 MYB transcription factors. Three TFs MYB28, MYB76, and MYB29, also referred to as HIGH ALIPHATIC GLUCOSINOLATE (HAG) 1, 2, and 3, respectively, have been described. HAG1 has been speculated to have a 'master regulator' effect by up-regulating almost all genes involved in the core structure formation of aliphatic GSLs. In Brassica field crops, the role of MYB28 genes have been demonstrated to be strongly associated with aliphatic GSL biosynthesis in B. oleracea, B. juncea and B. rapa. The gene CYP79F1 controls the first step of the core structure formation by converting chain elongated methionine to corresponding aldoximes. Its role in GSL biosynthesis has also been demonstrated in B. juncea and B. oleracea.The transfer of knowledge from Arabidopsis to B. napus is limited and complicated due to its polyploid genome, where multiple genes with functional redundancies may exist. Several genes associated with GSLs in rapeseed have been revealed through associative transcriptomics, genome-wide association, and QTL mapping studies. These studies demonstrated the significant association between biosynthesis genes BnMYB28 and BnCYP79F1 with high aliphatic GSL content.Our study aimed to reduce aliphatic GSLs in rapeseed since they are the most abundant in seeds. We analyzed the expression profiles of three BnMYB28 and two BnCYP79F1 paralogs in rapeseed. Then, we selected BnMYB28.C09, BnMYB28.A03, BnCYP79F1.C05 and BnCYP79F1.A06 as candidate genes for functional studies. Using an ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenized winter rapeseed population, we detected loss-of-function mutations in BnMYB28 and BnCYP79F1 genes involved in the core structure biosynthesis of aliphatic GSLs. Double mutants displayed a significant reduction in the seed aliphatic GSL content. These materials could be interesting for breeding rapeseed with improved seed meal quality by achieving a further reduction of aliphatic GSLs in the seeds.", "results": "ResultsIdentification of MYB28 and CYP79F1 genes in the oilseed rape genomeFor identification of possible paralogs in rapeseed, the Darmor-bzh reference genome (https://www.genoscope.cns.fr/brassicanapus/) was searched for MYB28 and CYP79F1 genes using polypeptide sequences from A. thaliana genes AtMYB28 (AT5G61420) and AtCYP79F1 (AT1G16410) as queries. Based on the lowest e-values and highest sequence similarities (> 80%), three and two paralogs were detected for BnMYB28 and BnCYP79F1, respectively (Table 1, Supplementary Fig. S1). The polypeptides of BnMYB28 and BnCYP79F1 shared a similarity of 85% and 86%, respectively with their corresponding Arabidopsis orthologs. We aligned the polypeptide sequences of the candidate paralogs to identify conserved functional domains characteristic for the R2R3 MYB transcription factor and cytochrome P450 gene families (Supplementary Fig. S2). In line with previous reports, the highly conserved DNA binding R2 and R3 domains specific to the subgroup 12 MYB transcription factors and the nuclear localization signal with the 'LKKRL' amino acid residues were present across protein sequences of all three BnMYB28 paralogs. The paralog BnMYB28.C09 was annotated in a truncated form in the Darmor-bzh and Express617 reference genomes but harbored all conserved domains required for gene activity. The protein sequences of both BnCYP79F1 paralogs possessed five conserved domains characteristic to the family of cytochrome P450 enzymes, including a 'heme' group speculated to act as the catalytic domain.Expression profiles of BnMYB28 and BnCYP79F1 genes reveal putative functional paralogsFor knock-out studies, we aimed to select highly expressed paralogs. Therefore, we investigated the expression profiles of BnMYB28 and BnCYP79F1 genes in the German winter-type inbred rapeseed Express617 by RT-qPCR. The relative expression of candidate genes was analyzed in leaves and seeds at growth stages 15, 25, 35, and 45 days after pollination (DAP).The two BnMYB28 paralogs BnMYB28.C09 and BnMYB28.A03 showed a thousand fold higher relative expression in leaves than seeds across all growth stages (Fig. 1). BnMYB28.C09 was the most highly expressed paralog in leaves. However, expression sharply declined 15 DAP and remained low during later stages of seed development (25-45 DAP). The expression of BnMYB28.A03 was consistently lower across all growth stages in the leaves, accounting for ~ 17% of the expression levels of BnMYB28.C09. In leaves BnMYB28.Cnn expression was not detectable, whereas measurable expression was detected at later stages towards seed maturity. Conclusively, BnMYB28.C09 and BnMYB28.A03 were selected for further studies as putative functional paralogs because they were significantly expressed in the leaves.Similar to BnMYB28, BnCYP79F1 paralogs were significantly more expressed in the leaves than seeds, attaining a 100-fold higher expression level. There was also a significant difference between the two BnCYP79F1 paralogs in leaves as the expression of BnCYP79F1.C05 was more than tenfold higher than BnCYP79F1.A06 (Fig. 1). In contrast, the expression levels of BnCYP79F1.A06 was higher than BnCYP79F1.C05 in seeds. In the early stages of seed development (15 DAP), BnCYP79F1.A06 was tenfold higher expressed than BnCYP79F1.C05, followed by a drastic decrease as the plants matured. In leaves, the expression of BnCYP79F1.C05 sharply increased between 25 and 35 DAP and then decreased as the plants approached maturity. Interestingly, BnMYB28 and BnCYP79F1 genes displayed opposite expression patterns in the leaves. While BnMYB28 was highly expressed at early stages (15 DAP) followed by a sharp decline, BnCYP79F1 expression increased during later stages (25-35 DAP).EMS-induced mutants for selected BnMYB28 and BnCYP79F1 paralogsWe screened the M2 population for EMS-induced mutations in four genes (BnMYB28.C09, BnMYB28.A03, BnCYP79F1.C05, and BnCYP79F1.A06) using a conventional polyacrylamide gel-based assay. We detected 35 and 43 EMS-induced mutations in BnMYB28 and BnCYP79F1 paralogs, respectively (Supplementary Table S4), which could be classified into 6 nonsense, 50 missense, and 22 silent mutations (Fig. 2). No splice site mutations were detected. Mutation frequencies ranged between 1/31.5 and 1/67.0 kb across the two gene families. On average, a frequency of one EMS-induced mutation per 43.6 kb was detected (Supplementary Table S5), which is in the range of estimations made by former studies on this EMS population. Both BnMYB28 nonsense mutations were located within the conserved DNA binding R2 domain. Additionally, seven missense mutations were also detected within the R2 domain. We found one nonsense mutation in the BnCYP79F1.C05 paralog, while none could be detected for BnCYP79F1.A06. A missense mutation conferring a minor change to the protein folding due to the exchange of lysine with glutamic acid was selected. For further studies, we chose all M3 plants with nonsense mutations plus the BnCYP79F1.A06 missense mutant. For ease of understanding, we assigned unique one-letter codes to wildtype and mutant alleles (Table 2).Due to high functional redundancies of genes in the polyploid oilseed rape genome, single mutations rarely have a phenotypic effect. Therefore, we crossed single mutants of BnMYB28.C09 and BnMYB28.A03 and then separately for BnCYP79F1.C05 and BnCYP79F1.A06 to produce distinct double mutants of BnMYB28 and BnCYP79F1, respectively. We genotyped M3 plants by generating PCR fragments encompassing the expected mutations (Supplementary Table S2) and confirmed single M3 mutants by Sanger sequencing of the PCR fragments (Supplementary Table S6). Mutant plants were selected for crossing experiments (Supplementary Table S7). BnMYB28 and BnCYP79F1 M3 single mutants were crossed with each other (referred to as 'M3xM3'). F1 offspring were selfed to generate the F2 populations 200527 (Supplementary Fig. S3A) and 200529 (Supplementary Fig. S3B), respectively.Mutations in BnMYB28 and BnCYP79F1 confer a significant reduction in the aliphatic GSL content in seedsWe investigated the effect of EMS-induced mutations in BnMYB28 and BnCYP79F1 genes by quantitative and qualitative analysis of GSLs. Segregating individuals from two F2 populations (200527 and 200529) were analyzed (Supplementary Table S7) along with non-mutagenized Express617 plants as controls. F2 populations 200527 and 200529 originated from M3xM3 crosses of BnMYB28 and BnCYP79F1 single mutants, respectively.First, F2 plants from the two populations were genotyped by Sanger sequencing. Four genotypes per population were selected for phenotypic studies. In F2 populations 200527 and 200529, plants homozygous for the wildtype alleles (AeAeBeBe and CeCeDeDe), homozygous for one mutant allele (A1A1BeBe or AeAeB1B1 and C1C1DeDe or CeCeD1D1), and homozygous for two mutant alleles (A1A1B1B1 and C1C1D1D1) were selected for phenotyping (Supplementary Fig. S3A,B).In general, a significantly higher GSL content was observed in seeds than in leaves (Fig. 3). In seeds of BnMYB28 double mutants (F2 population 200527), the GSL content was significantly (p < 0.05) reduced to 23.41 micromol/g DW compared to F2 plants homozygous for the wildtype alleles (47.28 micromol/g DW) and the non-mutagenized Express617 control plants (49.73 micromol/g DW), which corresponds to a significant GSL reduction by 50.5% and 52.9%, respectively (Fig. 3). Interestingly, single mutants of BnMYB28.A03 (26.96 micromol/g DW) showed a significant reduction in seed GSL content in contrast to BnMYB28.C09 single mutants (49.42 micromol/g DW). The seed GSL content in BnMYB28.A03 single mutants were in the range of the BnMYB28 double mutants. No significant differences were observed between the leaves of BnMYB28 double mutants (0.96 micromol/g DW) and the Express617 control (0.86 micromol/g DW). Also, the BnCYP79F1 double mutants (F2 population 200529) showed reduced seed GSL contents by 27.9% and 26.9% compared to the Express617 controls and the F2 plants homozygous for the wildtype alleles, respectively. However, the difference was not statistically significant (p < 0.05). GSL contents in leaves varied between 0.9 and 1.5 micromol/g DW in the BnCYP79F1 double mutants and 0.7-1.5 micromol/g DW in the wildtype F2 plants without statistically significant differences between the genotypes.Then, individual seed GSL profiles were analyzed in the same plants as performed for total GSL determination. Single GSLs were identified by retention time and co-chromatography with commercial standards and quantified using individual calibration curves (Supplementary Table S3). Although the estimation of total GSL by summing up the major compounds identified by HPLC yielded generally higher values than the enzymatic method, the results did not show significant differences between mutants (Supplementary Fig. S4). This suggested that our data evaluation for single GSL identification via HPLC and the sum of their concentrations were in line with the total GSL content estimated with the enzymatic test. Eight seed sample extracts were analyzed by LC-MS (Iontrap) to confirm the peak identity. All previously calibrated glucosinolates were confirmed. Moreover, two additional aliphatic glucosinolates (gluconapoleiferin and glucoalyssin) and the major indolic glucosinolate 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin, for which no calibration standards were available, could be identified and were quantified based on their UV absorbance at 229 nm using sinigrin (as internal standard) and calibration factors from the literature.In the seeds, we identified nine aliphatic GSLs (glucoiberin, progoitrin, epiprogoitrin, sinigrin, glucoraphanin, gluconapoleiferin, glucoalyssin, gluconapin, and glucobrassicanapin) in varying quantities and four other GSLs (4-hydroxyglucobrassicin, glucotropaeolin, glucobrassicin, and gluconasturtiin) in smaller amounts. In line with previous reports, the aliphatic GSL comprised the major portion (93.9%) of the seed GSL content in all genotypes studied here (Fig. 4).In BnMYB28 F2 double mutants (population 200527), the progoitrin concentrations in seeds were 55.3% lower than in the Express617 controls (reduced from 36.32 micromol/g DW to 16.20 micromol/g DW) (Fig. 5, Supplementary Table S8). The next abundant aliphatic compounds in the seeds were gluconapin and glucobrassicanapin. While glucobrassicanapin levels were drastically reduced by 87% from 5.26 micromol/g DW in the Express617 controls DW to 0.64 micromol/g DW in the double mutants, the gluconapin content was not significantly reduced. The minor aliphatic compound epiprogoitrin, whose synthesis starts from gluconapin, was reduced by 51% (0.57 micromol/g DW) in the double mutants compared to Express617 (1.17 micromol/g DW). The remaining seed GSLs analyzed did not exceed 3 micromol/g DW. Out of the 28 micromol/g DW reduction observed in the total seed GSL content of double mutants, the three major aliphatic GSLs accounted for 86% (24 micromol/g DW) of the total reduction. In the BnCYP79F1 F2 double mutants, the progoitrin content was 32.4% lower than in Express617 (36.32 micromol/g DW compared to 24.5 micromol/g DW) (Fig. 5, Supplementary Table S9). The glucobrassicanapin content was not altered in the BnCYP79F1 double mutants. However, a 30.4% decrease in gluconapin content suggests that the BnCYP79F1 mutations might have a bigger effect on the synthesis of short-chained 4C aliphatic than on the 5C aliphatic GSLs."}, "34298919": {"doi": "10.3390/ijms22147301", "title": "Influence of Genotype on High Glucosinolate Synthesis Lines of Brassica rapa", "abstract": "This study was conducted to investigate doubled haploid (DH) lines produced between high GSL (HGSL) Brassica rapa ssp. trilocularis (yellow sarson) and low GSL (LGSL) B. rapa ssp. chinensis (pak choi) parents. In total, 161 DH lines were generated. GSL content of HGSL DH lines ranged from 44.12 to 57.04 mumol g-1 dry weight (dw), which is within the level of high GSL B. rapa ssp. trilocularis (47.46 to 59.56 mumol g-1 dw). We resequenced five of the HGSL DH lines and three of the LGSL DH lines. Recombination blocks were formed between the parental and DH lines with 108,328 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in all chromosomes. In the measured GSL, gluconapin occurred as the major substrate in HGSL DH lines. Among the HGSL DH lines, BrYSP_DH005 had glucoraphanin levels approximately 12-fold higher than those of the HGSL mother plant. The hydrolysis capacity of GSL was analyzed in HGSL DH lines with a Korean pak choi cultivar as a control. Bioactive compounds, such as 3-butenyl isothiocyanate, 4-pentenyl isothiocyanate, 2-phenethyl isothiocyanate, and sulforaphane, were present in the HGSL DH lines at 3-fold to 6.3-fold higher levels compared to the commercial cultivar. The selected HGSL DH lines, resequencing data, and SNP identification were utilized for genome-assisted selection to develop elite GSL-enriched cultivars and the industrial production of potential anti-cancerous metabolites such as gluconapin and glucoraphanin.", "intro": "1. IntroductionThere is experimental evidence supporting the idea that compounds in Cruciferous plants are effective against cancer and heart ailments. Strong anti-carcinogenic effects of members of the family Brassicaceae are attributed to their glucosinolate (GSL) content. For consumption, some GSLs such as glucoraphanin (GRA), glucoalyssin (GAL), gluconapin (GNA), neoglucobrassicin (NGBS), and gluconasturtiin (GNT) are considerably beneficial whereas hydrolysis products from progoitrin (PRO), epiprogoitrin (epiPRO), and gluconapoleiferin (GNL) can cause goiter in animals. GSLs are not actual bioactive agents, but rather their hydrolysis products such as isothiocyanates (ITCs), nitriles, epithionitriles, thiocyanates, and indoles. Some of the important bioactive compounds are butenyl sulforaphane (SFN), isothiocyanate (BITC) and pentenyl isothiocyanate (PEITC) (Figure 1).The biosynthesis of GSL is one of the more complex processes and more than 130 GSLs have been identified so far. The existence of the different GSL structures is controlled by variability in genes on individual genotypes, especially at loci involved in initial elongation and side-chain modification reactions. In addition, the molecular function of a gene can be altered depending on the plant species, allelic condition, and polymorphic state of the regulatory network controlling it. According to previous works, four major loci, GS-ELONG, GS-OX, GS-AOP (GS-ALK and GS-OHP), and GS-OH, control the difference in the accumulation of aliphatic GSLs. GS-ELONG consists of genes methylthioalkylmalate synthase 1 (MAM1), MAM2, and MAM3 to regulate the chain length of GSLs. The GS-OX loci contain flavin monooxygenase (FMOGS-ox) and GS-AOP two tightly linked loci, GS-ALK for 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (AOP2) and GS-OHP for AOP3 involved in the side-chain modification reaction determines the type of GSL products. AOP2 genes are responsible for the conversion of GRA to GNA. In most B rapa, GNA makes up the major proportion of total GSL. However, the presence of stop codons in B. oleracea leads BoAOP2.2 and BoAOP2.3 into non-functional genes. This results in the major GSL content in B. oleracea being GRA instead of GNA. GS-OH locus controls oxidation of 3-butenyl GSL to alkenyl GSL. Most importantly, the accumulation and content of GSL are strongly influenced by R2R3-myeloblastosis (MYB) transcription factors (TFs). MYB28, MYB29, and MYB76 regulate the aliphatic GSL genes while MYB34, MYB51, and MYB122 regulate the indolic GSL genes. For fine mapping and selection of individual genotypes, it is necessary to identify allelic discrepancies on key loci and for different TFs.Resequencing provides the opportunity to develop a vast amount of novel markers. Identification of genes related to important agronomic traits, genetic diversity analysis, characterize and environmental factors influences are mandatory in genome-assisted breeding for crop improvement. Combining quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping with whole-genome sequencing helps in the precise detection of functional loci for traits of interest and their candidate genes. Major advantages of resequencing are functional allele mining and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) discovery between large populations. The identification of trait loci in biparental cross populations by high-resolution linkage map and functional allele mining utilizing SNPs and Insertions-Deletions (InDels) as markers provides a powerful complementary strategy to genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Recently, Chen et al. (2016) resequenced 199 and 119 accessions representing 12 and nine morphotypes of B. rapa and B. oleracea, respectively. This resequencing data aided in the identification of leaf-heading and tuberous morphotypes associated with sub-genome parallel selection during diversification and domestication of B. rapa and B. oleracea. Meanwhile, the resequencing of 588 B. napus accessions led to the identification of A and C sub-genome origins. Similarly, genome mapping helped to characterize genes responsible for club root resistance, blackleg resistance, black rot resistance, and flowering time, etc.B. rapa is one of the model plants for GSL metabolism and polyploid species with phenotypically diverse cultivated subspecies. In our previous study, we determined that eight subspecies of B. rapa have different GSL levels ranging from 4.42 mumol g-1 dry weight (dw) in B. rapa ssp. narinosa to 53.51 mumol g-1 dw in B. rapa ssp. trilocularis. The current study was conducted to identity SNPs based on resequencing between high GSL (HGSL) and low GSL (LGSL) content doubled haploid (DH) lines generated from two different parents, B. rapa ssp. trilocularis (yellow sarson) and B. rapa ssp. chinensis (pak choi). Yellow sarson is an oil plant with relatively high amounts of several beneficial GSLs, whereas pak choi is one of the major leafy vegetables in Korean and Chinese diets but contains lesser amounts of GSL. The aim of this work is to produce edible DH lines with high beneficial GSLs and low toxic substances like PRO. Detailed analysis of recombinant blocks between the HGSL and LGSL lines was carried out based on GSL biosynthetic pathways.

As neither of these accessions were perfect inbred genotypes, we performed selfing for four generations (S4) of YS-033 and named LP08. DH plant of PC-099 was named LP21. LP08 and LP21 were used as the set of homozygous parents. The F1 plant was developed using a female of LP08 and male of LP21 (Figure 2). Microspore cultures were followed according to our previous method. The leaf edge shapes were segregated in female and male parent's phenotype boundary (Figure 2, middle). Phenotype classification of the leaf edge shape consisted of (a) entire, (b) slightly serrated, (c) intermediately serrated, and (d) very serrated. Our population was named \"BrYSP_DH000\" in accordance with B. rapa (Br), yellow sarson + pak choi (YSP), doubled haploid (DH), and a unique three-digit number for each line. The regulation of GSL biosynthesis was then examined in Chiffu, LP08, LP21, F1, and 161 BrYSP_DH plants.We selected five HGSL lines and three LGSL lines among the 161 BrYSP_DH plants for further studies, including resequencing and GSL analysis (Table 1, Figure 2). Total GSL amounts were detected from 44.12 +- 2.86 mumol g-1 dw (BrYSP_DH005) to 57.04 +- 1.54 mumol g-1 dw (BrYSP_DH026). It was consistent with the range of total GSL for B. rapa ssp. trilocularis, a higher GSL content subspecies in our previous study (47.46 to 59.56 mumol g-1 dw). The most abundant GSL in the HGSL lines was GNA, which was 80 to 91% of the total GSL. We selected the HGSL lines based on lesser PRO content (<0.6 mumol g-1 dw) as PRO is known to cause harmful effects on human health. As shown in Table 1, the BrYSP_DH005 line exhibited a highly unique profile with enriched aliphatic GSLs GRA (1.23 +- 0.18 mumol g-1 dw) and GAL (3.47 +- 0.18 mumol g-1 dw), indolic GSL NGBS (2.03 +- 0.20 mumol g-1 dw), and aromatic GSL GNT (0.68 +- 0.34 mumol g-1 dw). Significance difference between the DH lines was observed in all GSLs (Table 1).2.2. Resequencing of Parents, HGSL Lines, and LGSL LinesSequencing reads of 150 bp were generated using 10 paired-end sequencing libraries of 350 bp insert size. Resequencing of LP08 and LP21 produced around 775 and 704 million raw reads, respectively. The total bases of sequence obtained were 78.2 Gb for LP08 and 71.1 Gb for LP21. The sequences of the DH lines ranged from around 125.5 to 192.4 million clean reads. These reads sequenced were mapped to the B. rapa v3.0 reference genome. Mapping reads (%) between parents differed with 90.65% (LP08) and 93.19% (LP21). The DH lines had slightly higher and more similar mapping read percentages, ranging from 94.8% to 95.98%. The genome coverages for the two parent sequences had a 157.05x depth for LP08 and 156.07x depth for LP21. Nine DH line were mapped from 46.89x (BrYSP_DH059) to 70.80x (BrYSP_DH026) (Table 2).2.3. SNP Genotyping and InDelsApproximately ~3.5 million and ~2.5 million SNPs were predicted in LP08 and LP21 lines in reference to B. rapa v3.0 genome, respectively. SNP density was calculated as 27.5 per 1-kb in LP08 and 22.2 per 1-kb in LP21. The maximum number of InDels were identified in LP08, i.e., 724,760. Comparatively, a lesser number of InDels were detected in LP21, i.e., 552,220. On average, 2,707,400 high-quality SNPs and 617,408 InDels were identified in the DH lines. Details regarding the SNPs and InDels of the parents and DH lines are provided in Table S1.2.4. Identification of GSL Biosynthesis-Specific Recombinant BlocksOverall, 108,328 variants were extracted as allelic differences between LP08 and LP21 in the recombinant block search of 342 recombinant blocks among the genotypes (Table S2, Figure S1). Out of 110 GSL biosynthetic genes, 75 were identified in recombinant blocks and mapped to their respective chromosomes (Figure 3). Uniformly, the recombinant blocks between the region of 12,929,867-23,248,122 bp of A03 with 3716 SNPs were discovered and identified to be present in only the HGSL lines (Table 3). The ten GSL synthesis genes positioned between 12.9 Mb and 23.2 Mb of A03 commonly differed between all resequenced HGSL and LGSL lines. In detail, TFs MYB28.1 of aliphatic GSLs and MYB34.2 of indolic GSLs of the HGSL lines were LP08 types. Similarly, for the chain elongation step, branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase 4 (BCAT4; Bra001761), MAM1 (Bra013007), MAM3 (Bra013009 and Bra013011), and bile acid transporter 5 (BAT5; Bra000760) of the HGSL lines belong to LP08. AOP1 (Bra000847) and AOP2 (Bra000848) were the two keys genes derived from LP08 in high GSL lines for the side-chain modification process. One of the genes involved in the sulfur donation from chloroplast to sulfotransferase for production of desulfo GSL, APS kinase (APK)1 (Bra013120) is the LP08 type in all high GSL lines (Table 3).Though all MAM genes are LP08 type in BrYSP_DH005, only three MAM genes are LP21 types in other high DH lines. In a similar way, all MAM genes were LP21 in BrYSP_DH059 and BrYSP_DH061 but three genes were LP08 type in the BrYSP_DH009 line. Even though in the core structure synthesis phase of BrYSP_DH005 most of the genes were identified as LP21 type, other HGSL lines showed about 50% of genes were LP08 type. It is noteworthy that BrYSP_DH014, BrYSP_DH026 and BrYSP_DH016, BrYSP_DH017 shared similar parental type recombinant blocks of GSL biosynthetic genes.   2.5. Comparative Analysis of GSL Pathway between Individual GenotypesStepwise comparative analysis on the GSL biosynthetic pathway between the HGSL line BrYSP_DH005 and LGSL line BrYSP_DH059 was performed based on the recombinant blocks of parents LP08 and LP21. Key differences were observed between BrYSP_DH005 and BrYSP_DH059 in amino acid elongation and side-chain modification step TFs such as MYB28 and MYB29. Entire MAM1, AOP1, AOP2, and GSL-OH genes of BrYSP_DH059 were present as LP21 recombinant blocks. In contrast, complete MAM1, one AOP1 (Bra000847), two AOP2 (Bra018521 and Bra000848), and one GSL-OH (Bra022920) were LP08 blocks in BrYSP_DH005. Interestingly, all genes of indolic and aromatic pathways in BrYSP_DH059, except ST5a (Bra024634) and UGT74B1 (Bra024634), were LP21 recombination blocks. Contrastingly, critical genes for the synthesis of glucobrassicin (GBA) in BrYSP_DH005, such as ST5a (Bra008132 and Bra015935), and CYP81F2 (Bra020459 and Bra006830), were LP08 blocks. Except for MYB28.2 (Bra035929), TFs involved in the biosynthesis of the aliphatic GSL were LP08 blocks in BrYSP_DH005, whereas, aliphatic TFs of BrYSP_DH059 were LP21 blocks. A similar trend was observed in MYB34 TFs. Other than MYB34.2 (Bra013000), all MYB34 homologues in BrYSP_DH005 were LP08 types. MYB34 TFs in BrYSP_DH059 remained as the LP21 genotype (Figure 4).2.6. GSL Hydrolysis ProductsMain hydrolysis products of GSL such as BITC, 4-PEITC, 2-PEITC, and SFN of high GSL lines were compared with the commercial pak choi cultivar used in South Korea. All five of the representative HGSL DH lines possessed increased amounts of hydrolysis products. Overall, BrYSP_DH014 had the highest level of hydrolysis products (870.29 microg g-1 dw). It is about 6.3-fold higher levels than that of the commercial cultivar. The HGSL line with the lowest level of hydrolysis products was the BrYSP_DH017 line which is about 417.5 microg g-1 dw. Still, it had a 3.0-fold high-level hydrolysis product than that of the control pak choi. Most importantly, the amount of anti-carcinogenic agent SFN in BrYSP_DH005 was 20.2 microg g-1 dw. This was 7-10-fold higher than that in the other HGSL DH lines and nearly 35-times more than that of the commercial cultivar (Table 4).2.7. Nitrile FormationAmong the five HGSL DH lines tested, BrYSP_DH005 showed significantly lower nitrile formation compared to that of the other HGSL DH lines, from both SNG and GNT substrate-based assays (Figure 5). The lower SNG substrate-based nitrile formation may explain why BrYSP_DH005 generated higher concentrations of SFN compared to other HGSL DH lines (Table 4). Although a decrease in GNT-based nitrile formation was observed in BrYSP_DH005 compared with other HGSL DH lines, it was more increased than the commercial pak choi."}, "37688976": {"doi": "10.1016/j.redox.2023.102873", "title": "Glucosinolate-rich broccoli sprouts protect against oxidative stress and improve adaptations to intense exercise training", "abstract": "Oxidative stress plays a vital role for the adaptive responses to physical training. However, excessive oxidative stress can precipitate cellular damage, necessitating protective mechanisms to mitigate this effect. Glucosinolates, found predominantly in cruciferous vegetables, can be converted into isothiocyanates, known for their antioxidative properties. These compounds activate crucial antioxidant defence pathways and support mitochondrial function and protein integrity under oxidative stress, in both Nrf2-dependent and independent manners. We here administered glucosinolate-rich broccoli sprouts (GRS), in a randomized double-blinded cross-over fashion to 9 healthy subjects in combination with daily intense exercise training for 7 days. We found that exercise in combination with GRS significantly decreased the levels of carbonylated proteins in skeletal muscle and the release of myeloperoxidase into blood. Moreover, it lowered lactate accumulation during submaximal exercise, and attenuated the severe nocturnal hypoglycaemic episodes seen during the placebo condition. Furthermore, GRS in combination with exercise improved physical performance, which was unchanged in the placebo condition.", "intro": "IntroductionShort periods of intense exercise training have been shown to induce substantial metabolic and circulatory adaptations that can improve health and physical performance. At the same time, exercise training imposes a significant organismal challenge with increased oxidative and energetic stress that needs to be managed through homeostatic mechanisms. One such mechanism is the transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) which activates critical endogenous antioxidant defence pathways and maintain mitochondrial function and protein integrity during oxidative stress. Also, Nrf2 is crucial in coordinating the adaptive response to exercise training (see Table 1).Lack of Nrf2 has been shown to negatively affect skeletal muscle function after exercise in aged mice and it also causes a faster decline in physical performance and muscle mass with age. Acute exercise seems to increase mRNA of Nrf2 in both mice and humans as a response to oxidative stress. Although moderate exercise activates Nrf2, periods of excessive exercise have been shown to decrease Nrf2 expression and impair mitochondrial respiration with a simultaneous loss of metabolic adaptations and induce disturbances in glucose control.Extensive research has demonstrated that the administration of direct antioxidants, such as vitamin C or E, during periods of exercise training may hamper the adaptive responses associated with training under certain circumstances. These findings suggest that exercise-induced oxidative stress could exert advantageous signaling effects, contributing to the beneficial adaptations observed in response to exercise. Similarly, a cellular environment subtly skewed towards pro-oxidant conditions may be associated with improved adaptations to exercise training.Expanding on the interplay between oxidative stress and exercise adaptations, isothiocyanates deserve attention. Isothiocyanates are a group of chemicals derived from glucosinolates found in plants in the Brassica genus that includes broccoli, kale, cauliflower, rocket, etc. Upon chewing or mechanical processing, glucosinolates become hydrolysed to isothiocyanates by the enzyme myrosinase. Although, more than 100 isothiocyanates have been identified to date and several have Nrf2-activating and other potent properties, the by far most studied isothiocyanate is sulforaphane. In addition to being potential Nrf2-activators, isothiocyanates also have Nrf2-independent properties, including inhibition of mitochondrial fission and the mTOR pathway.Isothiocyanates are electrophiles and function dually as pro-oxidants and antioxidants, much like exercise. They can disrupt cellular functions by forming covalent adducts, demonstrating acute pro-oxidant effects. Through this transient oxidative stress, in the longer term, they enhance cellular antioxidant defenses and upregulate phase II detoxification enzymes. This balance makes isothiocyanates compelling therapeutic candidates for conditions related to oxidative stress. Notably, isothiocyanates and particularly sulforaphane, have repeatedly been shown to stimulate endogenous antioxidant systems through Nrf2 activation in animal models following treatment periods typically spanning several days. Intriguingly, studies have demonstrated an acute decrease in blood glutathione alongside with reductions in its precursors, glutamine and cysteine, in the hours following the ingestion of fresh isothiocyanate-rich broccoli sprouts. This pattern suggests an initial rise in oxidative stress following GRS intake, which is subsequently counteracted by enhanced activation of endogenous antioxidants. To date, only a few studies have tested the effects of isothiocyanate administration in combination with exercise. Wang et al. found that mice receiving sulforaphane before exercise in hypoxia had higher expression of the lactate transporter MCT-1 and higher lactate dehydrogenase activity together with an increased running capacity. Similarly, mice receiving an intraperitoneal dose of sulforaphane showed upregulated Nrf2 expression and improved running capacity, an effect absent in Nrf2-deficient mice. Furthermore, young men receiving sulforaphane supplement for two weeks had higher mRNA expression of the Nrf2-target NQO1 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and experienced less muscle soreness after a bout of intense weight training exercise. In a placebo controlled cross-over study, young men received 30 mg of sulforaphane daily for 4 weeks and performed heavy resistance exercise sessions. Both creatine kinase and interleukin-6 were reduced after sulforaphane treatment indicating attenuated muscle damage and inflammation.In the present study we applied a program of 7 consecutive days of exercise with High intensity interval training (HIIT) and twice daily administration of a glucosinolate rich sprout drink (GRS) or a placebo drink (PLA) in a double-blinded, placebo controlled cross-over fashion. The intent was to challenge the adaptive capacity and the antioxidative defence of the subjects and determine if administration of GRS in combination with exercise could activate Nrf2, enhance physical performance and protect against potential negative effects of excessive exercise.", "results": "ResultsSkeletal muscle Nrf2 protein is modulated after GRS and exercise and protects against oxidative stressWe first wanted to understand if the intense exercise with GRS or PLA had increased the protein abundance of Nrf2 and activated the antioxidative defence system. We therefore measured Nrf2 in skeletal muscle homogenates using western blot technique. We found a near-significant main effect of training (p = 0.09) and a post-hoc test revealed that Nrf2 was significantly upregulated only in the GRS condition after exercise training (p = 0.03, pre compared to post) but not in the PLA condition (p = 0.83, pre compared to post, Sidaks post-hoc test). See Fig. 1a. Nrf2 activation is associated with induction of antioxidative genes, which should protect against exercise-induced oxidative stress. To assess whether GRS treatment also affected markers of oxidative stress we measured carbonyl content and malondialdehyde levels in the skeletal muscle homogenates. We found a significant interaction effect on carbonyl content between the GRS and PLA conditions. From pre to post exercise carbonyl content increased from 0.64+-0.06 to 0.71+-0.05 in the PLA condition and decreased from 0.75+-0.06 to 0.65+-0.05 in GRS (p = 0.03 by interaction), Fig. 1b. However, malondialdehyde levels were not changed both by either exercise or treatment (from 237+-20 to 270+-34 in PLA and from 200+-17 to 234+-17 in GRS, Fig. 1c). Thereafter, we measured myeloperoxidase concentrations in plasma samples to investigate if the altered redox status of the muscle cells was also reflected in the blood. Indeed, we found that myeloperoxidase increased from 29.6+-2.6 to 32.4+-2.4 in the PLA condition and decreased from 32.5+-2.3 to 27.9+-2.3 ng/mL in the GRS condition (p = 0.002 by interaction, Fig. 1d). Together these results indicate an increased antioxidative defence and a marked reduction in oxidative stress after GRS-treatment compared to PLA despite a more modest upregulation of Nrf2. Considering that the functional activation of Nrf2 is driven by its translocation into the nucleus, the modest elevation of Nrf2 observed here in whole muscle homogenates could indeed correspond to a substantial increase at the nuclear compartment, thereby having a more pronounced effect on antioxidant gene expression.GRS decreases lactate accumulation during submaximal work and improves maximal performanceIn animal studies, it has been demonstrated that the activation of Nrf2 enhances exercise performance. A critical component of a physical performance improvement is the diminished accumulation of lactate during submaximal work, which indicates a primary adaptive response.To investigate this further, we assessed capillary lactate levels during submaximal exercise. Notably, we observed a significant interaction effect where the lactate concentrations were markedly lower following the administration of GRS, as compared to PLA, under submaximal workload conditions. During submaximal work the average lactate concentration increased in PLA from pre 2.69 +- 0.24 to post 3.17 +- 0.35 mM and decreased in GRS from pre 3.06 +- 0.24 to post 2.66 +- 0.20 mM (p = 0.003 by interaction), see Fig. 2a. As can be seen in Fig. 2b, the work rate at an absolute lactate concentration was improved by 15-20 W or ~15%. During an incremental exercise test to exhaustion maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max) was not significantly affected (3.12-3.14 L min-1 in PLA and 3.13-3.22 L min-1 in GRS, main effect p = 0.10, interaction effect p = 0.19, Fig. 2c). However, time to exhaustion during the maximal test was significantly improved in the GRS condition (from 401+-19 to 406+-22 s in PLA and 380+-22 to 426+-21 s in GRS, p = 0.02 by interaction, Fig. 2d). A well-known negative effect of intense periods of training is a reduction in maximum heart rate. Here we found maximum heart rate significantly decreased from 187+-3 to 184+-3 bpm in PLA but unchanged from 185+-3 to 185+-3 bpm in the GRS, p = 0.03 by interaction, see Fig. 2e.A change in lactate concentrations during submaximal exercise could indicate a change in substrate preference. Therefore, we measured oxygen consumption (VO2) and carbon dioxide emission (VCO2) during submaximal work rate where the respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (VCO2/VO2) reflects substrate utilization. We found no main effects of the intervention but there was a tendency towards an interaction effect (p = 0.06) for a difference in RER at moderate work rates from 0.968+-0.01 to 0.982+-0.01 in PLA and from 0.973+-0.01 to 0.971+-0.01 (see Fig. 2f) possibly indicating a shift towards higher reliance on lipid oxidation after GRS compared to PLA.Mitochondrial respiration and content are unchanged after GRS and PLAIncreases in mitochondrial capacity and function are expected outcomes of endurance exercise training. At a given submaximal work rate, a higher mitochondrial capacity should divert more pyruvate into mitochondrial oxidation instead of a reduction to lactate by lactate dehydrogenase. To understand if the lower lactate concentrations during exercise after GRS is due to an increase in mitochondrial content we assessed the activity of citrate synthase in the muscle tissue, but found it was unchanged in both conditions (from 6.5+-2.4 to 6.9+-4.6 in PLA and 6.6+-2.3 to 6.9+-3.0 mumol min-1 g-1 dw in GRS, (Fig. 3a). We also measured mitochondrial function by High Resolution Respirometry in isolated mitochondria but found no significant main or interaction effect by the intervention (Fig. 3b). Therefore, other mechanisms than an increased mitochondrial capacity must be responsible for the reduction in lactate.GRS markedly attenuates nocturnal hypoglycaemia during periods with intense exercise trainingIntense exercise training periods seem to correlate with a higher incidence of both hypo- and hyperglycaemic episodes in elite athletes. Sulforaphane has been demonstrated to normalize exaggerated hepatic glucose production and improve Hba1c in specific diabetic patient subgroups. We aimed to corroborate these findings in our current study population, investigating whether GRS-rich sprouts could improve blood glucose control. Interstitial glucose was continuously monitored throughout the seven-day long training period, revealing that time spent with glucose below 4 mM averaged 5 h 21 min +- 67 min per day in the PLA group. In contrast, it decreased to 2 h 16 min +- 51 min daily in the GRS group (p = 0.002) Fig. 4a. Additionally, the mean blood glucose was significantly lower (4.67+-0.11 mM in PLA versus 5.02+-0.10 mM in GRS, p=<0.0001, Fig. 4b). Nonetheless, the time with blood glucose exceeding 8 mM was similar in both groups (10+-6 min in PLA and 16+-4 min in GRS per 24 h, Fig. 4c). Despite the substantial changes in CGM readings, the fasting insulin levels at the post-tests were unchanged between conditions (7.5+-1.4 mU L-1 in PLA, and 7.4+-1.4 mU L-1 in GRS, p = 0.92, t-test, Fig. 4d). The CGM readings represents weekly average readings across all subjects. However, given that meals and training sessions took place at slightly different times each day throughout the week, this approach might overlook subtle variations in the data. We therefore looked more specifically at the glucose response at the time around each exercise session. We discovered a significant interaction effect that pointed to distinct glucose responses under the GRS and PLA conditions. During exercise, the glucose level in the GRS group was slightly elevated but remained stable. In contrast, the PLA group started with a lower glucose level, peaked to match the GRS group towards the end of the exercise, but then dipped to a lower level again (Fig. 4e). Statistically, these variations were significant; treatment effect p = 0.04 and interaction effect p = 0.001. Given the potential differences between glucose levels measured in the interstitial fluid and in the blood, we sought to validate our findings using capillary blood measurements taken during the post-test. Although these tests were performed 24-72 h after the last training session, we observed a significant treatment effect, characterized by marginally elevated blood glucose levels during submaximal exercise and following the maximal exercise test (p = 0.02 by treatment effect, Fig. 4f). This in-depth analysis underscores the differential impact of the GRS and PLA treatments on glucose dynamics during exercise.The findings regarding altered glucose and lactate levels in blood could indicate that GRS treatment may influence the synthesis or utilization of glycogen in skeletal muscle. This, in turn, could contribute to the observed changes in glucose and lactate dynamics. Notably, the primary source for lactate formation in skeletal muscle is muscle glycogen. As such, the lower capillary lactate levels observed during exercise might serve as an indicator of decreased glycogen concentrations. We thus proceeded to assess muscle glycogen in muscle homogenates. Our findings revealed a borderline significant interaction effect (p = 0.059). As illustrated in Fig. 4g, there was an observable increase in glycogen post-training within the PLA group, a trend not mirrored in the GRS group. This adds a layer of complexity to our understanding of the impact GRS treatment has on metabolic processes."}, "34525252": {"doi": "10.1111/pbi.13707", "title": "Genome- and transcriptome-wide association studies reveal the genetic basis and the breeding history of seed glucosinolate content in Brassica napus ", "abstract": "SummaryA high content of seed glucosinolates and their degradation products imposes anti-nutritional effects on livestock; therefore, persistent efforts are made to reduce the seed GSL content to increase the commercial value of rapeseed meal. Here, we dissected the genetic structure of SGC by genome-wide association studies (GWAS) combined with transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). Fifteen reliable quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were identified to be associated with the reduced SGC in modern B. napus cultivars by GWAS. Analysis of the selection strength and haplotypes at these QTLs revealed that low SGC was predominantly generated by the co-selection of qGSL.A02.2, qGSL.C02.1, qGSL.A09.2, and qGSL.C09.1. Integration of the results from TWAS, comprehensive bioinformatics, and POCKET algorithm analyses indicated that BnaC02.GTR2 (BnaC02g42260D) is a candidate gene underlying qGSL.C02.1. Using CRISPR/Cas9-derived Bna.gtr2s knockout mutants, we experimentally verified that both BnaC02.GTR2 and its three paralogs positively regulate seed GSL accumulation but negatively regulated vegetative tissue GSL contents. In addition, we observed smaller seeds with higher seed oil content in these Bna.gtr2 mutants. Furthermore, both RNA-seq and correlation analyses suggested that Bna.GTR2s might play a comprehensive role in seed development, such as amino acid accumulation, GSL synthesis, sugar assimilation, and oil accumulation. This study unravels the breeding selection history of low-SGC improvement and provides new insights into the molecular function of Bna.GTR2s in both seed GSL accumulation and seed development in B. napus.", "intro": "IntroductionCanola-type rapeseed (Brassica napus, AACC, 2n = 38) is currently one of the main oil crops and a promising alternative to soybean source protein feed in the world (Chao et al.,; Gatrell et al.,; Wang et al.,). However, earlier unimproved rapeseed cultivars contain high seed glucosinolate (GSL) concentrations, which reduce the nutritional value and feed quality of the seed (Schmidt and Bancroft,). 'Bronowski,' a feed landrace used in Poland in the late 1960s, provided the only germplasm source for breeding seed GSL content (SGC) in B. napus (Agnihotri et al.,). Subsequently, with the discovery of low-erucic cultivar 'Liho', the 'double-low' (low seed erucic acid and GSL content) B. napus varieties have been successfully developed and quickly popularized in major B. napus growing countries since the 1990s (Agnihotri et al.,; Burton et al.,; Gupta and Pratap,). However, glucosinolates (GSLs) are important defence compounds for resistance to herbivores and pathogens in plants (Wittstock et al.,). Reportedly, the efforts made to reduce the GSL contents in seeds have concurrently reduced the GSL contents in leaves and other tissues, resulting in an overall decline in disease and stress resistance in B. napus (Li et al.,; Mithen,). Therefore, tissue-specific control of GSL accumulation is of great significance for the quality improvement of B. napus (Nour-Eldin et al.,).The GSL biosynthesis pathway has been widely studied in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana and has evolved to produce more than 130 GSL structures with multiple amino acid-derived side chains (Agerbirk and Olsen,; Fahey et al.,). Based on different precursor amino acids for side chains, GSL can be classified as aliphatic (methionine, alanine, valine, leucine, or isoleucine), aromatic (tyrosine or phenylalanine), and indolic (tryptophan) GSL (Blazevic et al.,; Clarke,). GSL biosynthesis can generally be divided into three stages: extension of the side chain, formation of the core structure, and modification of the R-side chain (Barco and Clay,; Fahey et al.,). Many gene families including BCATs (Lachler et al.,; Schuster et al.,), MAMs (Redovnikovic et al.,; Textor et al.,), CYP79 family (Hansen et al.,; Reintanz et al.,; Tantikanjana et al.,; Zang et al.,), CYP83 family (Bak and Feyereisen,; Hemm et al.,; Zang et al.,) and AOPs (Hall et al.,; Kliebenstein et al.,) participate in these processes. Several transcription factors have also been identified as important harbours in GSL biosynthesis. The R2R3-MYB transcription factors play an exclusive role in aliphatic and indole GSL biosynthesis (Burow et al.,; Gigolashvili et al.,). Disruption of HAG1/MYB28 and HAG3/MYB29 genes resulted in extremely low aliphatic GSL levels (Jules et al.,; Sonderby et al.,). Knockout and overexpression of ATR1/MYB34, HIG1/MYB51, and HIG2/MYB122 genes caused significant changes in the indolic GSL content (Celenza et al.,; Frerigmann and Gigolashvili,). Moreover, MYC2/MYC3/MYC4 transcription factors have been reported to indirectly modulate GSL synthesis through the regulation of R2R3-MYB transcription factors (Gigolashvili et al.,; Schweizer et al.,; Zimmermann et al.,).GSLs are mainly synthesized in nutrient-rich tissues, such as rosette leaves and silique walls, and then relocated to seed embryos by transporters as a non-uniform distribution pattern through the phloem (Chen et al.,; Du and Halkier,; Petersen et al.,). Recently, in Arabidopsis, two aliphatic GSL-specific bidirectional transporters, namely, GTR1 (also known as NPF2.10) and GTR2 (also known as NPF2.11) have been identified (Andersen et al.,; Nour-Eldin et al.,), and their role in long-distance transport of aliphatic GSL has been demonstrated in gtr1gtr2 double mutants:in the mutants, the accumulation of aliphatic GSL in root and leaf margins was strongly repressed (Madsen et al.,), and GSL-free seeds were successfully obtained (Nour-Eldin et al.,). Additionally, another GSL-specific transporter, GTR3 (also known as NPF2.9), together with GTR1 and GTR2, has been demonstrated to import indole GSL into storage cells (Jorgensen et al.,). However, most GSLs in Arabidopsis seeds are aliphatic GSLs, and indolic GSLs account for about 2% (Brown et al.,). In B. napus, multiple orthologs of GTR1 and GTR2 have been identified because of their highly duplicated genome status (Chalhoub et al.,; Song et al.,). In Brassica rapa, seven GTR homologs have been identified; however, the ethyl methanesulfonate-based mutation of BrGTR2A2 only has been shown to reduce the average SGC by 67 +- 5%. Similarly, mutation of four of the twelve GTR homologs in Brassica juncea has reduced the average SGC in the quadruple mutant (2A1/2A2/2B1/2B2) by 62 +- 10% (Nour-Eldin et al.,). In B. napus, eight Bna.GTR2 genes have been identified and annotated, of which three genes were silent in the seeds of double-low varieties and the remaining five genes were moderately expressed (Lu et al.,); however, associative transcriptome analysis showed that only the expression level of BnaA02.GTR2 in young leaves was related to the accumulation of GSL in seeds (Lu et al.,). These findings suggest that the different GTR2 paralogs seem to possess a conserved function in GSL transportation; however, their biological functions remain to be carefully defined in B. napus. Therefore, to achieve the goal of tissue-specific control of GSL accumulation, it is necessary to understand the source-sink relationship of GSLs and evaluate the availability of GSL transporters, especially GTR2.The development and application of genomic tools and techniques, such as QTL mapping (Brondani et al.,), genome-wide association study (GWAS; Lijun et al.,), and transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS; Tang et al.,), have contributed to a better understanding of gene regulatory networks and the genetic mechanisms underlying complex quantitative traits in crops (Yadava et al.,). In B. napus, GWAS or linkage association mapping methods have been used to identify relevant QTLs that regulate GSL biosynthesis and accumulation (Feng et al.,; Liu et al.,; Lu et al.,). Two to three major QTLs were found to control the SGC of several bi-parental mapping populations (Howell et al.,; Toroser et al.,; Zhao and Meng,). Subsequently, Feng et al. identified 71 seed-specific metabolite QTLs for GSL compounds. Furthermore, 43 QTLs for SGC were mapped over seven environments in Germany and China in a doubled haploid population in B. napus (Fu et al.,). With the rapid development of the new biotechnology, especially GWAS and TWAS, a considerable progress in the exploration of seed GSL accumulation in B. napus has been made in recent years. Through associative transcriptomics, Lu et al. identified 10 SNPs closely linked to genes related to SGC. Furthermore, Wang et al. identified 49 loci related to SGC using high-throughput resequencing. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that combining genomic and transcriptomic approaches could unravel the genetic basis of SGC and provide insights into the application of transport engineering in B. napus breeding.Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively dissect the genetic basis of SGC at both the genomic and transcriptomic levels in B. napus by GWAS, TWAS, and co-expression network analysis. We identified 15 QTLs, 1854 genes, and regulatory networks associated with SGC. In addition, BnaC02.GTR2 was found to be a key gene influencing seed GSL accumulation as well as multiple seed traits.", "results": "ResultsGWAS deciphered QTLs associated with SGC in B. napus To determine the QTLs associated with SGC of B. napus, SGC of 505 B. napus accessions (Tang et al.,) was examined in Wuhan (WH) for 3 years (2017-2019). The Pearson coefficients of determination (R 2) of seed GSL phenotype data estimated using the best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP) method were stable in WH 2017-2019 (0.87-0.91) with improved R 2 between the years (0.94-0.98; Figure S1).We performed GWAS for SGC using a linear mixed model (LMM) in the genome-wide efficient mixed-model association (GEMMA) software (Buss et al.,; Figure S2). Significant association signals were detected using the threshold of 6.91 x 10-7 of BLUP value in the data of WH 2017-2019 (Dataset S1). Finally, 15 QTLs mainly located on chromosomes A02, A09, C02, and C09 were identified as stable QTLs, detected at least twice in 3 years (Datasets S2 and S1, Figure 1A). Of these QTLs, qGSL.A02, qGSL.A09, qGSL.C02, qGSL.C07, and qGSL.C09 were reported in previous studies (Feng et al.,; Harper et al.,; Liu et al.,). Approximately, in the 150 kb region covered by the 15 QTLs, we identified 669 genes as GWAS-associated candidate genes (Dataset S3).TWAS unravelled the molecular basis of seed GSL accumulationTwenty days after flowering (DAF) and 40 DAF are critical developmental stages for seed filling and embryo growth, with the accumulation of GSL in B. napus (Gijzen et al.,; Larden and Triboi-Blondel,; Murphy and Cummins,; Yu et al.,). To further explore the genetic basis of seed GSL accumulation, we performed TWAS using the seed transcriptome data of two populations comprising 309 accessions at 20 DAF and 274 accessions at 40 DAF (Tang et al.,). We found 851 and 1327 genes significantly associated with SGC at 20 and 40 DAF (false discovery rate, FDR < 0.05; Figure 1b,c, Datasets S4 and S5), which contained 44 and 8 known GSL-associated genes, respectively (Datasets S6 and S7). Among the significantly associated genes, 324 genes were identified simultaneously in both stages (Figure 1D). Moreover, many GSL-associated genes identified here were underlying in several major QTLs, such as qGSL.A09.2, qGSL.C02.1, and qGSL.C09.1 (Figure 1b,c).We further performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of genes significant in TWAS (FDR < 0.05) at 20 DAF. The results showed that many GSL-associated genes participated in the GSL biosynthesis process, phosphorylation, and hydrogen sulphide biosynthetic process (Figure 1e; Dataset S8). Genes encoding transporters, such as GTR2 (AT5G62680) and BAT5 (AT4G12030), transcription factors including HAG1/MYB28 (AT5G61420) and MYC3 (AT5G46760), as well as cytochrome P450 family members, CYP83A1 (AT4G13770) and CYP79F1 (AT1G16410), were positively associated with SGC at 20 DAF (Dataset S6). However, a few genes such as PEX14 (AT5G62810), TWD 40-2 (AT5G24710), and NADP (AT5G62420) were negatively associated with SGC at 40 DAF (Dataset S7), and these GSL-associated genes at this stage were mainly involved in several biological processes such as starch catabolism, arginine catabolism and regulation of DNA-templated transcription (Figures S3A,B, Datasets S9 and S10). Notably, both GSL synthesis and GSL transport-related genes, HAG1/MYB28, BAT5, and GTR2 were identified to be positively associated with SGC at 20 and 40 DAF (Datasets S6 and S7). These results indicate that many genes involved in multiple biological processes affect the accumulation of GSL during seed development in B. napus. BnaC02.GTR2 is likely a key gene for seed GSL accumulation in B. napus Genes with the same or similar functions can usually be divided into modules based on their expression patterns, and analysis of the relationship between modules and traits could help discover key genes controlling the trait (Ma et al.,). Analysis of the relationship between modules and trait can help discover the key genes controlling the trait. We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) to identify highly synergistic sets of genes for independent modules from GWAS and TWAS results (DiLeo et al.,; Langfelder and Horvath,). It has been shown that scale-free networks can make gene sets more to identify biologically more meaningful gene sets (Hein et al.,). Therefore, we estimated the best soft-thresholding power (beta) value for constructing the scale-free network at 20 and 40 DAF. The beta that allowed scale independence to exceed 0.85 for the first time was used as a threshold to classify the gene modules (Figure S4). At 20 and 40 DAF, 15 and 11 co-expression modules (beta20DAF = 14, beta40DAF = 8) were divided for further analysis (Figure 2a,b). At 20 DAF, three modules were significantly positively correlated with SGC (red: r = 0.63, P = 1 x 10-35; brown: r = 0.54, P = 1 x 10-24; midnight blue: r = 0.34, P = 6 x 10-10; Dataset S11). Among them, the red module contained GTR2, PEX14, and other genes related to the transport of some other metabolites. The brown module contained genes related to GSL synthesis, such as BAT5 and IPMI2 (AT2G43100). At 40 DAF, two modules were significantly positively correlated with SGC (black: r = 0.69, P = 2 x 10-39; purple: r = 0.34, P = 5 x 10-9; Dataset S12). GTR2 and PEX14 are also present in the black module. Additionally, we found that the gene significance (GS) of these genes was very high in two stages (BnaC02.GTR2: GS20 DAF = 0.64, GS40 DAF = 0.55; BnaA09.PEX14 (BnaA09g06240D): GS20 DAF = 0.56, GS40 DAF = 0.56; Figure 2c, Datasets S13 and S14).To identify the key genes controlling the SGC of B. napus, we extracted 74 genes significant in TWAS localized in SGC-related QTL intervals at two stages. Of these 74 genes, 39 genes, including the SGC-related genes orthologous to GTR2, HAG1/MYB28, APO3 (AT5G61930), TAF5 (AT5G25150), PYRD (AT5G23300), and ORE14 (AT5G62000), were present in 15 stable QTLs (Figure 2c; Dataset S15). The POCKET algorithm, which integrates multi-omics data and is based on machine learning, can prioritize candidate genes in QTL intervals (Tang et al.,). We used POCKET to analyse the functional ranking of co-localized genes in qGSL.C02.1. BnaC02.GTR2 with the highest GS at 20 and 40 DAF was highly ranked in qGSL.C02.1 (Figure S5, Dataset S16). To study the effect of BnaC02.GTR2 on SGC accumulation, we analysed the relationship between variant genotypes and phenotypes of BnaC02.GTR2 in the population. The coding region and the upstream 2 kb promoter region of BnaC02.GTR2 were classified into four major haplotypes in 505 accessions, and a significant difference in SGC between the haplotypes (Figure 2d) was observed. The haplotype B possessed a significantly higher average SGC (94.40 mumol/g) than the other three haplotypes with a P-value of 5.71 x 10-17, whereas no significant difference in average SGC among the remaining three haplotypes was observed. Therefore, we speculated that sequence variations in the BnaC02.GTR2 coding and promoter regions might be responsible for variation in SGC in B. napus. In addition, correlation analysis of population phenotype and gene expression showed that BnaC02.GTR2 positively regulated the SGC in B. napus ( = 0.40, P 20 DAF = 2.85 x 10-32;  = 0.28, P 40 DAF = 1.44 x 10-21; Figures 2e,f). These results indicate that BnaC02.GTR2 could be the causal gene underlying qGSL.C02.1.Selection analysis of QTLs associated with low SGC in B. napus breedingTo explore the QTLs that could be utilized in breeding programs to develop low-SGC varieties, we divided the lead SNP of QTLs into ancient and derived haplotypes, of which the latter generated from the ancient alleles (Tang et al.,). We found that nine QTLs (qGSL.A02.1, qGSL.A02.2, qGSL.A08.1, qGSL.A09.1, qGSL.A09.2, qGSL.A09.4, qGSL.C02.1, qGSL.C09.1, and qGSL.C09.3) had specific haplotypes. Comparison of the nucleotide diversity (pi) values of ancient and derived haplotypes revealed that six QTLs were strongly selected and four of these were located on chromosomes A09 and C09 (Figures 3a,c,e, and S6). Based on the structural delineation of 505 accessions in previous studies, semi-winter population 1 (SW1) corresponded to low SGC and low-erucic acid accessions and semi-winter population 2 (SW2) corresponded to double-high accessions (Tang et al.,). In different subpopulations, the derived alleles of qGSL.A09.2 and qGSL.C09.1 had major effects on SGC (Figures 3d,f, and S7A to I). Based on the results of QTL candidate gene prediction, BnaA09.PYRD and BnaC09.HAG1/MYB28 were predicted to be the candidate genes of qGSL.A09.2 and qGSL.C09.1, respectively (Figures S8 and S9). BnaC02.GTR2 and its paralog BnaA02.GTR2 (BnaA02g33530D) were present in qGSL.C02.1 and qGSL.A02.2, respectively. Interestingly, the ancient and derived haplotypes of the two QTLs had low and similar pi values (Figures 3a and S6D). This suggests that GTR2 may have indispensable functions during seed development, making it highly conserved in B. napus. Both qGSL.C02.1 and qGSL.A02.2 had large effects on SGC in subpopulations (SW1 and SW2), and their low-SGC haplotypes were mainly distributed in SW1 with low-SGC phenotypes (Figures 3g and S7A,B). Interestingly, the seed oil content (SOC) and thousand seed weight (TSW) were not affected by these two QTLs based on haplotype analysis (qGSL.A02.2: p SOC = 0.40, p TSW = 0.42; qGSL.C02.1: p SOC = 0.46, p TSW = 0.08; Figure S10). Taken together, these results suggest that despite the conservation status of both BnaA02.GTR2 and BnaC02.GTR2, breeding selection strategies effectively utilized the natural variations that singularly affect SGC.Notably, the phenotypic distribution of haplotypes for the four QTLs (qGSL.A02.2, qGSL.C02.1, qGSL.A09.2, and qGSL.C09.1) were similar with the mean difference of SGC between the two haplotypes ranging from 52.60 to 67.47 mumol/g in the population (Figures 3b,d,f and S6D). To explore how the phenotypic distribution characteristics of these QTLs were shaped, we analysed the haplotypes of qGSL.A09.2, qGSL.C09.1, and qGSL.C02.1 that represent the effects of GTR2 in both qGSL.C02.1 and qGSL.A02.2 in the 154 low-SGC accessions. These results showed that in 151 accessions, the low-SGC haplotypes were identically associated with all three QTLs (Figure 3g). We then selected the top five accessions with extremely low SGC and extremely high SGC from the 505 accessions, respectively. Notably, the low-SGC haplotypes in the four large-effect QTLs (qGSL.A02.2, qGSL.C02.1, qGSL.A09.2, and qGSL.C09.1) were consistently present in the five low-SGC accessions (Figure 3h). These results suggested that the low-SGC accessions were mainly generated by co-selection of multiple large-effect QTLs, of which contained key GSL-associated genes GTR2, PYRD, and HAG1/MYB28 (Figure 3a,c,e).Disruption of Bna.GTR2s conferred low SGC but affected several seed traits in B. napus The correlation coefficient analysis showed that six GTR2 homologs in B. napus could be divided into two groups. The first group, including BnaA06.GTR2 (BnaA06g22160D), BnaC03.GTR2 (BnaC03g51560D), BnaA02.GTR2 and BnaC02.GTR2 had a higher protein sequence similarity with GTR2 than the second group containing BnaA09.GTR2 (BnaA09g06190D) and BnaC09.GTR2 (BnaC09g05810D; Figures 4A and S11A). Therefore, to explore the potential functions of Bna.GTR2 homologs, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system to edit the four homologous genes belonging to the first group (Figure S11A). We designed two sgRNAs (sgRNA1 and sgRNA2) that specifically target the major facilitator superfamily conserved domain (Wang et al.,) in exons 4 and 5 of all four Bna.GTR2 homologs, respectively (Figures S11B,C). In total, 29 T0-positive transgenic plants were obtained and 10 homozygous T2 lines with mutations in the four homologous genes were identified by sequencing the target sites. The homozygous mutations caused amino acid substitutions, frameshifts or premature stop codons that resulted in truncated MFS conserved domains (Dataset S17). Further sequence analysis showed that the potential off-target sites were not mutated (Datasets S17 and S19).Subsequently, we measured the SGC phenotype of different Bna.gtr2 homozygous mutants. Each of the four single-locus Bna.gtr2 mutants showed significant decrease in SGC compared with the wild-type (WT) recipient (cv.13CK-3), with BnaA02.gtr2 (a02) and BnaC02.gtr2 (c02) showed the most significant decrease, whereas BnaC03.gtr2 (c03) and BnaA06.gtr2 (a06) showed a moderate decline. Moreover, the BnaA02.gtr2 and BnaC02.gtr2 double mutant (a2c2), as well as BnaA02.gtr2, BnaC02.gtr2 and BnaC03.gtr2 triple mutants (a2c2c3) also exhibited significant decreases in SGC compared with a02 or c02. Notably, the average SGC of the BnaA02.gtr2, BnaC02.gtr2, BnaA06.gtr2, and BnaC03.gtr2 quadruple mutant (a2c2a6c3) was 18.21 mumol/g, representing an 86.85% decrease compared with WT (Figure 4B; Dataset S20). These results revealed the crucial function of Bna.GTR2s in seed GSL accumulation. In addition, our findings showed that different Bna.GTR2 homologs studied here affected SGC to different degrees and a partially functional redundancy commonly existed among the four homologs.Surprisingly, the TSW of the a2c2a6c3 quadruple mutant was decreased by 64.35% compared with that of WT seeds, similar to the reduction degree of SGC (Figure 4C; Dataset S21). Additionally, seed diameter showed significant decrease in Bna.gtr2 mutants compared with WT seeds (Figures 4E and S12, Dataset S22). Previous studies have shown that the main storage compounds accumulated in seeds of B. napus consist of storage triacylglycerols and proteins (Schwender et al.,). To investigate whether Bna.GTR2s affect other seed traits of B. napus; we examined SOC, protein content, and fatty acid composition in the mutants and WT seeds. Interestingly, the Bna.gtr2 mutant seeds showed a significant increase in SOC, a significant change in fatty acid composition, and varying degrees of decrease in protein content (Figures 4D and S13, Dataset S20). These results suggest that Bna.GTR2s can affect not only the SGC but also seed size and may participate in multiple aspects of dry matter accumulation in B. napus seeds.GSLs are synthesized mainly in vegetative tissues, such as leaves and roots, and are finally transported to seeds in Arabidopsis. Therefore, we also detected the GSL content in the roots and leaves of BnaC02.gtr2 mutants. The results showed that the GSL content of the roots and the leaves of the mutants were 9.42 and 6.29 mumol/g, respectively. Compared with WT, the GSLs content of the mutants were significantly decreased in the leaves but significantly increased in the roots, which means that the transport of GSL synthesized in the roots to other vegetative tissues may be inhibited, resulting in the accumulation of GSL in the roots. (Figure S14, Dataset S23). BnaC02.GTR2 is involved in multiple processes during the seed development of B. napus It is noteworthy that the altered SGC of BnaC02.gtr2 mutant was accompanied by a variety of traits associated with seed development (Figures 4B to E), which means that SGC-related genes or BnaC02.GTR2 may be associated with seed development. To verify this hypothesis, we first re-observed the genes detected by TWAS at 20 and 40 DAF that were significantly associated with SGC and found that 73 and 56 of them were associated with amino acid, sugar, and fatty acid accumulation in Arabidopsis seeds, respectively (Figures S15a,b, Datasets S24 and S25). These results suggested that SGC-related genes were inextricably linked to the process of seed development. Then, we conducted a correlation analysis between the expression of BnaC02.GTR2 and genes significant in TWAS related to seed development at 20 DAF [the critical period of seed dry matter accumulation (Yu et al.,)]. The results showed that BnaC02.GTR2 was significantly positively correlated with genes, such as ARF2 (AT5G62000), EMB2024 (AT5G24400), etc., and negatively correlated with genes, such as SWEET5 (AT5G62850), TT4 (AT5G13930), and UGNT1 (AT4G32272). These genes are involved in multiple seed developmental processes (Figure 5a, Dataset S26; Bock et al.,; Engel et al.,; Meinke,; Okushima et al.,; Schruff et al.,; Tzafrir et al.,; Wang et al.,; Yu et al.,). Next, we constructed a co-expression analysis of BnaC02.GTR2 and seed development-related genes identified by TWAS at both 20 and 40 DAF and found that BnaC02.GTR2 is associated with multiple processes, such as plant development, protein accumulation, amino acid synthesis, GSL synthesis, sugar assimilation, and endosperm development (Figure 5b; Dataset S26). In addition, we used the gene expression of BnaC02.GTR2 at 20 DAF as a covariate for TWAS to re-performed TWAS analysis. Four hundred and six genes disappeared significantly compared with the previous result, and these genes were significantly enriched in the synthesis of GSL and different pathways of seed development (Dataset S27, Figure S16). These results suggested that BnaC02.GTR2 is an important factor affecting genes related to seed development.We also analysed the transcriptome of WT and BnaC02.gtr2 mutant in developing seeds at 20 DAF. We identified 45 076 expressed genes (mean TPM > 1 for each type), including 1234 were differentially expressed (|log2foldchange| > 1 and Padj < 0.05). A significant decrease in the expression of genes associated with GSL synthesis and transport was observed. Interestingly, not only is the expression of genes regulating aliphatic GSL [such as HAG1/MYB28, CYP83A1, BAT5, AOP2 (AT4G03060)] significantly reduced, but also for the synthesis of indolic GSL [e.g. CYP81F1 (AT4G37430), GSTF9 (AT2G30860), and IGMT1 (AT1G21100)], suggesting possible crosstalk between GSL transport and synthesis pathways. And we also observed a significant reduction in the expression of indolic GSL transporter GTR3. These implied that aliphatic and indolic GSL transporters may cooperate for GSL transport (Figure 5c; Datasets S28 and S29). Moreover, the expression of genes related to seed development also changed significantly [such as MYC4 (AT4G17880), CYP78A9 (AT3G61880), and CCoAOMT7 (AT4G26220)]. Among them, MYC4 plays a redundant role with MYC3 and MYC2 in the accumulation of Arabidopsis seed storage protein (Gao et al.,), which might be related to the protein content alteration in the seeds of BnaC02.gtr2 mutant (Figure S13A). Cytochrome P450 CYP78A9 is involved in Arabidopsis reproductive development and also regulates silique length and seed weight in B. napus (Sotelo-Silveira et al.,). In B. napus, a CACTA-like transposable element in the upstream region of BnaA9.CYP78A9 acts as an enhancer to increase silique length and seed weight (Shi et al.,). CCoAOMT7 encodes a caffeoyl-coenzyme A O-methyltransferase (CCoAOMT)-like protein, which contributes to lignin biosynthesis in the cell wall and may have a role on the development of seed coat (Yang et al.,; Yu et al.,). Furthermore, GO enrichment analysis indicated that the differentially expressed gene set between BnaC02.gtr2 mutant and WT at 20 DAF was enriched in multiple biological processes, including sulphate assimilation, GSL biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid binding, transporter activity, amino acid binding, and oligopeptide transport (Figure 5d; Dataset S30).Accordingly, these findings strongly suggest that SGC-related genes have possible associations with seed development. BnaC02.GTR2, with pleiotropic functions, might not only play a role in seed GSL accumulation, but also be involved in multiple approaches of seed development in B. napus."}, "32316621": {"doi": "10.3390/molecules25081860", "title": "Profiling of Individual Desulfo-Glucosinolate Content in Cabbage Head (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) Germplasm", "abstract": "Individual glucosinolates (GSLs) were assessed to select cabbage genotypes for a potential breeding program. One hundred forty-six cabbage genotypes from different origins were grown in an open field from March to June 2019; the cabbage heads were used for GSL analyses. Seven aliphatics [glucoiberin (GIB), progoitrin (PRO), epi-progoitrin (EPI), sinigrin (SIN), glucoraphanin (GRA), glucoerucin (GER) and gluconapin (GNA)], one aromatic [gluconasturtiin (GNS)] and four indolyl GSLs [glucobrassicin (GBS), 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin (4HGBS), 4-methoxyglucobrassicin (4MGBS), neoglucobrassicin (NGBS)] were found this study. Significant variation was observed in the individual GSL content and in each class of GSLs among the cabbage genotypes. Aliphatic GSLs were predominant (58.5%) among the total GSLs, followed by indolyl GSL (40.7%) and aromatic GSLs (0.8%), showing 46.4, 51.2 and 137.8% coefficients of variation, respectively. GIB, GBS and NGBS were the most common GSLs found in all genotypes. GBS was the most dominant GSL, with an average value of 3.91 micromol g-1 (0.79 to 13.14 micromol g-1). SIN, GIB, PRO and GRA were the other major GSLs, showing average values of 3.45, 1.50, 0.77 and 0.62 micromol g-1, respectively. The genotypes with relatively high contents of GBS, SIN, GIB and GRA warrant detailed studies for future breeding programs since the hydrolysis products of these GSLs have several anti-cancer properties.", "intro": "1. IntroductionGlucosinolates (GSLs), sulfur-containing compounds, are exclusively found in order Brassicales. They are derived from the amino acid biosynthetic pathway and are associated to the characteristic pungent flavor and odor of Brassica vegetables. GSLs are enzymatically hydrolyzed to isothiocyanates (ITCs), thiocyanates or nitriles by the endogenous enzyme myrosinase depending upon the nature of the GSLs. To date, about 132 different GSLs have been identified and characterized in a range of Brassica which have a specific GSL profile and content. GSLs are classified into aliphatic, aromatic and indolyl compounds based on the structure of their side chain and the type of the precursor amino acid. The GSLs and their breakdown products are known to have biologic and pharmacological effects, such as anti-fungicidal, anti-oxidative, anti-bacterial and anti-cancer. The isothiocyanates (sulforaphane, iberin, phenylethyl and prop-2-enyl) derived from glucoraphanin, glucoiberin, gluconasturtiin and sinigrin, respectively, have anti-proliferative and anti-cancer properties. Furthermore, degradation products such as indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and 3,3'-diindolylemethane (DIM) from an indolyl GSL; glucobrassicin also showed the activation of cancer preventive enzyme after hydrolysis. Phenylethyl isothiocyanate hydrolyzed from gluconastrutiin shows antimicrobial and anti-cancer activity against prostate and colon cancer by apoptosis. The alternative use of GSLs as synthetic pesticides for pest and disease control and bionematicides is also reported. Some aliphatic GSLs including sinigrin and progoitrin are also responsible for the bitter flavor of the Brassica vegetables and may influence the consumer acceptance. Therefore, the GSLs in Brassica vegetables should be investigated due to their dietary and medicinal properties.Among the green Brassica vegetables cultivated globally, cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) is one of the commonly grown and consumed due to its low cost and health promoting properties. It is highly nutritious and possess a wide range of health-promoting bioactive compounds such as GSLs, vitamins, phenols, anthocyanin and carotenoids. The profile and content of given bioactive compounds varies due to genetic and environmental factors such as growth seasons and conditions and developmental stages. GSL profile and their content have been studied in several Brassica vegetables: broccoli, radish, Chinese cabbage, rape, turnip and pakchoi. Furthermore, studies have been undertaken to understand how the GSL profiles and content in cabbage is affected by genotypes, growth seasons, developmental stages of different tissues, and postharvest storage. However, most of the studies related to the GSLs analysis in cabbage have been limited to a small number of genotypes as well as to the effects of the environmental factors. Furthermore, there is currently no information regarding variation in GSL profiles and their content using a large number of the genetic resources of different origin. Therefore, in this study we aimed to analyze the GSL profile and content in the heads of 146 cabbage genotypes grown in open field with identical conditions to investigate genetic variations and then to select the candidate genotype based on the targeted GSLs that may be used for the generation of high-GSLs containing genotypes.", "results": "2. Results and Discussion2.1. Variation in Agronomic CharacteristicsQualitative and quantitative parameters indicating different agronomic traits were measured during and after the harvest. Qualitative parameters such as shape of the head and inner and outer color of the leaf showed different patterns (Table S1). The head of the most genotypes was round (124 genotypes) while the head shape of the remaining genotypes was flat, semi-flat, semi-round, round and pointed, semi-flat and round, semi-round, pointed and upper pointed and round. The outer and inner leaf color was green in 130 cabbage genotypes and red in the remaining 16 genotypes. The detailed information about the leaf color is presented in supplemental file. The quantitative parameters showed great variability among the genotypes (Table S1). Leaf length showed three-fold difference, ranging from 22 to 66 cm and the average of 39.9 cm. The average head width, head height and core length were 15.9, 15.1 and 6.4 cm, and showed 2.6-, 3.0- and 4.1-fold difference to the lower and higher value of each parameter, respectively. The weight of the cabbage head showed 14.7-fold difference, with a range from 190 to 2800 g.2.2. Identification and Quantification of Individual GSLs Profile in CabbageAmong the analyzed 19 GSLs, twelve GSLs were identified in both green and red cabbage genotypes and quantified by using HPLC as presented in Figure 1 and Table 1. Seven aliphatic, one aromatic and four indolyl GSLs were identified based on the retention time of HPLC chromatograms. Each of the GSL clearly separated in both the standard mixture and cabbage sample. The detected GSLs in cabbage genotypes were GIB, PRO, EPI, SIN, GRA, GNA, GER, GBS, 4HGBS, 4MGBS, NGBS and GNS (Figure 1B) mostly consistent with previous findings. The identified GSLs were quantified using the standard curves created from commercial standards (Table 1).2.3. Variation in Individual and Total GSL Content among 146 Cabbage GenotypesThe total glucosinolate content varied from 3.99 to 23.75 mumol g-1 DW (Table 2) and was significantly different between the genotypes. The aliphatic GSLs were predominant, representing the 58.5% of the total GSLs, followed by indolyl GSL (40.7%) and aromatic GSLs (0.8%). The average content of aliphatic, indolyl and aromatic GSLs were 6.95, 4.46 and 0.09 mumol g-1 DW with an over 46.4%, 51.2% and 137.8% coefficient of variation, respectively. Among the individual GSLs, GBS was the most dominant comprising 33.8% of the total GSLs (Figure 2A), followed by SIN (27.9%), GIB (12.7%), PRO (6.5%) and GRA (6.0%). SIN represented the major aliphatic GSL comprising of an average of 47.7%, followed by GIB (21.6%), PRO (11.2%) and GRA (10.3%) (Figure 2B). The remaining aliphatic GSLs:GNA, EPI and GER comprised 6.9%, 1.8% and 0.5%, respectively.GIB, GBS and NGBS were found in all the genotypes among the detected 12 GSLs (Figure 3, Table S2). GBS was the most dominant GSL in 77 genotypes (Table S2) which account for 53% of the total genotypes and ranged from 0.79 to 13.14 mumol g-1 DW with an average of 3.91 mumol g-1 DW and exhibited 53.5% variation coefficient (Table 2). Among the 146 genotypes, 124 genotypes showed relatively low GBS content (<6.0 mumol g-1 DW) while 18 genotypes showed medium (6.0-9.0 mumol/g DW) and the remaining four genotypes showed the highest (> 9.0 mumol g-1 DW) GBS content (Figure 3). Our results are similar to Choi et al. and Cartea et al. who also found the GBS to be the most dominant GSL. However, the GBS content found in our study is significantly higher to those reported by Park et al. who found that GBS content varied between cabbage varieties from 0.1 to 8.0 mumol g-1 DW. The higher GBS content found in our study may be due to the larger number of cabbage genotypes and the diversity of their origins.SIN was the most dominant GSL in 62 genotypes accounting 42% of the total genotypes and its content ranged from 0.01 to 12.87 mumol g-1 DW with the average value of 3.55 mumol g-1 DW (Table 2). Most of the genotypes (117 genotypes) showed the range between 0.01 to 6.0 mumol g-1 DW (Figure 3). SIN content was higher than 6.0 mumol g-1 DW in 25 genotypes, consistent with Park et al. who also found SIN to be the most dominant GSLs and within the range of this study. Likewise, Pocock et al. found higher levels of SIN and GBS compared to the other GSLs in cabbage. The presence of high SIN in cabbage genotypes implies the pharmacological value as it shows the anti-glycation activity, inhibition of the proliferation of tumor cells and adipocyte differentiation, antioxidant activity and suppressive effects towards hypertriglyceridemia. The third most dominant GSL, GIB was found in all the genotypes ranging from 0.01 to 5.01 mumol g-1 DW with an average of 1.51 mumol g-1 DW. GIB comprised the 12.7% and 21.6% of the total GSLs and aliphatic GSLs (Figure 2). GIB content was the lowest (<1.0 mumol g-1 DW) in 59 genotypes, followed by medium levels (1.0-2.0 mumol g-1 DW) detected in 43 genotypes and the highest GIB content (4.0-5.0 mumol g-1 DW) detected in four genotypes (Figure 3). The value reported herein is relatively lower compared to the previous reports by Cartea et al. who found 2.7-12.1 mumol g-1 GIB in 26 cabbage varieties grown in Spain. Such discrepancies may be due to the difference in genotypes as well as environmental conditions. Furthermore, the GIB and SIN content in the cabbage genotypes was relatively higher than in broccoli emphasizing its higher health beneficial value. The high content of SIN, GIB and GBS in cabbage genotypes indicates a high pharmacological value of this crop as their breakdown products are allyl isothiocyanate, iberin and indol 3-carbinol, respectively and the hydrolysis products of these compounds have several anticancer properties.GRA, which is considered as the most important GSL due to its anticancer activities, was found in most of the genotypes (Figure 3). Many researchers are interested in enhancing the GRA content in Brassica vegetables due to its health-promoting activities. Similar to Park et al., GRA was the second most dominant GSLs among the aliphatic glucosinolates. However, we found a relatively low content (<1.0 mumol g-1 DW) of GRA in most genotypes (105 genotypes). GRA comprised 6.0% of the total GSLs and 10.3% of the aliphatic GSLs (Figure 2) with an average content of 0.62 mumol/g DW and 129.9% coefficient of variation among the genotypes. In contrast, Park et al. found that GRA content varied from 5.29 to 14.91 mumol g-1 DW accounting to 44% of total GSLs and 77% of aliphatic GSLs in the 38 cabbage lines grown in fall season. These discrepancies may be due to the differences between the genotypes as well as growing conditions, as the level of GSLs varies significantly between genotypes and environmental conditions.NGBS, the second most dominant indolyl GSLs, was found in all genotypes. NGBS content ranged from 0.1 to 2.0 mumol g-1 DW with an average of 0.4 mumol g-1 DW, however, most of the genotypes had less than 1.2 mumol/g DW of NGBS. Our result showed relatively higher NGBS compared to the previous reports by Park et al. in 45 lines of green and red cabbage. PRO, which is responsible for the bitter flavor and influences consumer choice, was also present in most of the genotypes, however most the genotypes showed >2.00 mumol g-1 DW and the coefficient of variation was 106%. The other GSLs constituted a small portion of the total GSL content: on average, 1.5% for EPI, 4.0% for GNA, 0.5% for 4HGBS, 0.3% for GER, 2.9% for 4MGBS and 0.8% for GNS. Cartea et al. also found similar results with the lower content of these GSLs while analyzing 26 cabbage varieties. Among the detected GSLs, GER was observed in the lowest number of genotypes (~16%) and its content was less than 0.60 mumol g-1 DW. Among the 12 quantified GSLs in cabbage, GER showed the highest coefficient of variation (280.5%), which was followed by GNS (137.8%) and GRA (129.9%), whereas EPI exhibited the lowest genetic variation (36.1%) (Table 2).Overall, the differences in total and individual GSL content were observed among the genotypes. The degree of genotypic variation was different for the individual GSL. The results found in this study are similar with previous reports in different Brassica vegetables including cabbage. However, this study provides more information about the GSL profile in a large number of cabbage varieties. The variation in GSLs levels found in this study implied that the potential health benefit of the cabbage crop is greatly influenced and dependent on the genotype.2.4. Selection of Candidate Genotypes for the Breeding ProgramAfter analyzing the individual GSLs and their content, some of the genotypes were selected based on the targeted GSLs (Table 3). Specifically, genotypes with the highest GBS, IBE, GRA and SIN content may have a potential for health benefits, as the hydrolysis product of these GSLs show anticancer properties. PCA for individual GSLs showed that some selected genotypes had higher specific GSL content (Table 3 and Figure 4). GBS was the highest in 908151, 906777, 189963 and 180,791 genotypes. Similarly, four genotypes, namely K004525, 180791, 803374 and 803360, showed a relatively higher GIB content than other GSLs. Six genotypes:908149, K045062, K246894, K139130, 907279 and 803369:had a relatively higher SIN content (>9.0 mumol g-1 DW) than the other genotypes; it was the highest in 908149 genotype. PCA further revealed that three genotypes:803346, 803372 and K004527:had a higher GIB content (>4.0 mumol g-1 DW) than the other genotypes. Three genotypes (K142931, K004526 and K247741) had a higher GRA content (>3.0 mumol g-1 DW), although total GSL content was lower compared to the other selected genotypes. These results suggest the use of these specific genotypes in breeding program to increase GSL content. Furthermore, five genotypes exhibited a higher PRO content, which should be considered given that high PRO content may affect the consumer choice as it produces oxazolidine-2-thione, which causes goiters in mammals and other harmful effects. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report reporting GSLs variation in a large number of cabbage genotypes with accurate quantification using 19 authentic standards in HPLC as most of the other previous studies were based on the response factors or LC-MS-based.2.5. Correlation Analysis among the GSLsThe correlation analysis was performed to investigate the accumulation pattern of individual GSLs and their interactions. In this study, individual GSLs correlated to each other differently (Table 4). The results showed a high significant correlation between major GSLs. The highest positive correlation was found between PRO and GNA (r = 0.805**) this is because PRO is directly synthesized from GNA. On the other hand, SIN exhibited either significantly negative or non- significant correlation with GRA (r = -0.555*), GER (r = -0.271**), PRO (r = -0.106) and EPI (r = -0.065) which was probably due to the difference in their intermediates biosynthetic pathway. GIB showed significant correlation with almost all of the GSLs with the highest positive correlation with SIN which may be because of the same biosynthetic pathway between the GIB and SIN. Among the indolyl GSLs, 4HGBS showed statistically insignificant correlation with almost all of the aliphatic and indolyl GSLs which may be due to the lower content of 4MGBS in almost all of the genotypes although it has the same precursor; tryptophan, for the biosynthesis of indolyl GSLs. The most dominant GSL, GBS showed either significant positive or statistically insignificant correlation to the other GSLs with the highest positive correlation with NGBS (r = 0.411**). Similar to the previous reports by Bhandari et al., the aliphatic GSLs, namely PRO, GNA, GRA and GER, showed a strongly positive correlation with each other as these GSLs are 4-carbon aliphatic GSLs and follow a similar biosynthetic pathway. The total GSL content had the highest significantly positive correlation with SIN (r = 0.658**), followed by GBS (r = 0.564**) and GIB (r = 0.576**) as these GSLs have high contribution to the total GSL content in cabbage."}, "32235638": {"doi": "10.3390/molecules25071591", "title": "The Role of Brassica Bioactives on Human Health: Are We Studying It the Right Way?", "abstract": "Brassica vegetables and their components, the glucosinolates, have been suggested as good candidates as dietary coadjutants to improve health in non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Different preclinical and clinical studies have been performed in the last decade; however, some concerns have been posed on the lack of established and standardized protocols. The different concentration of bioactive compounds used, time of intervention or sample size, and the lack of blinding are some factors that may influence the studies' outcomes. This review aims to analyze the critical points of the studies performed with Brassica-related biomolecules and propose some bases for future trials in order to avoid biases.", "intro": "1. IntroductionNowadays, the incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including obesity, diabetes, cancer, and other chronic conditions, is increasing and showing high mortality indexes worldwide (). These diseases are multifactorial, but it has been described that lifestyle, such as smoking or sedentary life, contributes to the prevalence of the NCDs. As a result, different prevention strategies have been developed, mainly the promotion of healthy habits, recommending avoiding a sedentary life, quitting smoking and the consumption of alcoholic drinks, and keeping a healthy diet. To emphasize the importance of these strategies, it has been proven that these habits have an important role in the prevention of cardiovascular diseases and type-II diabetes.Since one of the main points of intervention for a healthy lifestyle is diet, global health recommendations are always encouraging the message of eating a minimum of five portions of fruits and vegetables daily. Vegetables are not only a natural source of amino acids and minerals, but also of phytochemicals. In particular, cruciferous vegetables, like broccoli, cabbage, red radish, or Brussels sprouts, are consumed worldwide not only because of their culinary value being popular in many countries with plates being part of the culture legacy, but also because of their diverse content in phytochemicals with high health-promoting benefits. Between them vitamin C, polyphenols, and minerals can be found. However, one of the most relevant biomolecules are glucosinolates (GSLs), mainly found in plant species and varieties of the order Brassicales, mainly Brassicaceae as the most well-known representatives of this horticultural, botanical, and socioeconomically relevant botanical family. They consist of a basic structure of a thiohydroximate-O-sulfate group with a glycosylation and, depending on which amino acid they are derived from, a different side chain. GSLs are stable secondary metabolites, but after tissue disruption, they are hydrolyzed by the enzyme myrosinase (EC 3.2.1.147), generating different GSL hydrolysis products (Figure 1) including bioactive isothiocyanates (ITCs) if the pH is 5-8, in the range of neutrality. In some plants, epithiospecifier proteins exist and can modify the outcome of the hydrolysis process, typically to promote other products than ITCs, as it is the case of nitrile specifier protein originating simple nitriles and elemental sulfur. On the other hand, the epithiospecifier proteins (ESP) with similar function may also carry out a different reaction for the few aliphatic GSLs with a terminal double bond by adding the sulfur to this bond, forming an epitionitrile. The production of thiocyanates is produced at pH > 8, and oxazolidine-2-thiones can be formed if a hydroxyl group is present on carbon 2 (beta position) of the glucosinolate.The effect of cooking practices on the content of GSLs and degree of conversion to ITC/nitrile are also important when considering the use of cruciferous foods for clinical studies, and a relevant source for clarification is the review of Nugrahedi et al..Sulforaphane was discovered by Prochazka, but it became widely known after the study by Fahey et al. describing its involvement in cancer prevention. That pioneering study was in some ways misleading, as the protocol used (addition of purified myrosinase enzyme to chemical extracts of broccoli) could have masked the normal tendency of broccoli to form nitriles. Importantly, natural glucoraphanin and sulforaphane both have a chiral sulfinyl group in the side chain; the natural molecule is pure R-isomer. In contrast, some commercial glucoraphanin and sulforaphane has a sulfinyl group that is a mixture of the R and S isomers, because of semisynthetic preparation by chemical oxidation of a more easily available glucosinolate. Importantly, the artificial racemic mixture has different biological properties than the natural single stereoisomer, which is an important fact to know in the evaluation of published studies.Diverse bioactivities have been reported for ITCs, being strong inducers of phase II detoxification enzymes, their anti-carcinogenic effect, or their anti-inflammatory properties. Between aliphatic GSLs, glucoraphanin (GRA) is one of the most studied, since its resultant ITC, sulforaphane (SFN), has shown diverse properties on human health For example, it has been described that SFN exerts its main function acting over the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2). In normal conditions, Keap1 represses the interaction between the transcription factor Nrf2 and the sequence motif present in nuclear DNA known as antioxidative response element (ARE) through sequestration and the subsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of Nrf2. However, the interaction between SFN and Keap1 interferes with the suppression of Nrf2, allowing the transcription of phase II cytoprotective proteins. Furthermore, also the subject of study has been the intervention of SFN in the nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NFkappaB), decreasing its capability of binding target sequences related to inflammatory processes, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha).Another abundant GSL present in cruciferous vegetables is glucobrassicin (GB), whose main degradation product is ascorbigen. However, its corresponding indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and its condensation product 3,3-diindolylmethane (DIM) have been the main focus of medical research because they were readily commercially available. Glucobrassicin was discovered as the precursors of the already known ascorbigen I3C and DIM were found to be formed in vitro, but not in vivo. From the very fast formation of ascorbigen at plant pH, it is well established that I3C is neither an intermediate in the in vivo formation of ascorbigen, which must be due to reaction with ascorbic acid with an earlier intermediate in the glucobrassicin breakdown. Early authors (e.g., Bjeldanes, in the 1980s) suggested indoles to be cancer protecting; later authors noted Janus properties, being either protectors or carcinogens depending on the timing of the carcinogen and the indole, as reviewed by, e.g., Holst and Williamson and Agerbirk et al..Although several studies showed that DIM interferes with diverse signal transduction pathways implied in tumorigenic and inflammatory processes, such as AKT kinase, phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K), NFkappaB pathway, or EGFR/ERK, the exact interaction has not been yet elucidated. Furthermore, it has been studied that the growth and expansion of certain cancer types, as colorectal, are promoted by the presence of pro-inflammatory interleukins, like TNFalpha and IL-6. These molecules activate pathways regulated by NFkappaB and transcription factor STAT3, inducing and maintaining in time a pro-inflammatory microenvironment. In this way, carcinogenic cell proliferation, tumor invasion, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression are promoted. The work of Zou et al. showed that when human ovarian cancer cells (SKOV3 and A27809) were treated with DIM, a downregulation in STAT3 and a subsequent inhibition in cell adhesion and invasion was observed.All these studies performed in vitro suggest that cruciferous vegetables mainly from Brassica spp. (either as foods or ingredients rich in bioactive substances) are good candidates as dietary coadjutants to improve human health in NCDs. As a consequence, some clinical and pre-clinical studies have been developed during the last six years. Epidemiological studies have linked the intake of GSLs with the risk of coronary heart disease or type 2 diabetes. Nevertheless, this information from large cohorts is usually based in food frequency questionnaires, making it difficult to know the specific effects of the GSLs in the intake. On the other hand, promising anti-cancer results have been obtained from interventional studies but, due to the reduced sample size, cannot be interpreted as a generalization. In general, the studies analyzed in our review did not present an established and standardized protocol, differing in the concentrations of the component, time of the intervention, and sample size. Moreover, not all of them presented a double-blind design. For all that, this review aims to analyze the critical points of the studies performed with Brassica-related biomolecules with the aim to establish a basis for future trials and avoid biases.

This study aims at correlating the content of aliphatic glucosinolates to the expression of genes involved in their synthesis in Brassica oleracea, and perform functional analysis of BoMYB29 gene. To this purpose, three genotypes were used: a sprouting broccoli, a cabbage, and a wild genotype (Winspit), a high glucosinolate containing accession. Winspit showed the highest transcript level of BoMYB28, BoMYB29 and BoAOP2 genes, and BoAOP2 expression was positively correlated with that of the two MYB genes. Further analyses of the aliphatic glucosinolates also showed a positive correlation between the expression of BoAOP2 and the production of sinigrin and gluconapin in Winspit. The Winspit BoMYB29 CDS was cloned and overexpressed in Winspit and in the DH AG1012 line. Overexpressing Winspit plants produced higher quantities of alkenyl glucosinolates, such as sinigrin. Conversely, the DH AG1012 transformants showed a higher production of methylsulphinylalkyl glucosinolates, including glucoraphanin, and, despite an up-regulation of the aliphatic glucosinolate genes, no increase in alkenyl glucosinolates. The latter may be explained by the absence of a functional AOP2 gene in DH AG1012. Nevertheless, an extract of DH AG1012 lines overexpressing BoMYB29 provided a chemoprotective effect on human colon cells. This work exemplifies how the genetic diversity of B. oleracea may be used by breeders to select for higher expression of transcription factors for glucosinolate biosynthesis to improve its natural, health-promoting properties.Electronic supplementary materialThe online version of this article (10.1007/s11103-019-00890-2) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.", "intro": "IntroductionBrassica oleracea (CC genome) is a member of the Brassicaceae family and one of the three diploid Brassica species in the \"triangle of U\" (Nagaharu) that also includes the diploids B. rapa (AA) and B. nigra (BB) and the allotetraploids B. juncea (AABB), B. napus (AACC) and B. carinata (BBCC). Each of the Brassica genomes has undergone a specific whole-genome triplication (Lysak et al.). Brassica oleracea comprises many important vegetable crops including cauliflower, broccoli, cabbages, Brussels sprouts, kohlrabi and kales, which are high in carotenoids (Kopsell and Kopsell) and contain diverse glucosinolates (GSLs), secondary metabolites, naturally produced by plants of the Brassicaceae family (Traka and Mithen). A group of GSL products derived from enzymatic hydrolysis, isothiocyanates (ITCs), play important roles in human health and agriculture. Isothiocyanates are considered the main components responsible for the cancer-preventing properties of Brassica plants upon consumption by humans (Traka and Mithen). For instance, sulforaphane, the aliphatic ITC generated from hydrolysis of 4-methylsulphinylbutyl GSL (glucoraphanin), exhibits chemopreventive properties, prohibiting the development of cancer cells via suppression of cytochrome P450 enzymes, induction of apoptotic pathways, inhibition of angiogenesis, anti-inflammatory activity and suppression of cell cycle progression (Juge et al.; Abdull Razis et al.). Sulforaphane also activates the human Nrf2 transcription factor promoting the action of phase II detoxification enzymes, thus increasing cell defence against oxidative damage and enhancing the elimination of carcinogens (Chi et al.; Su et al.). Conversely, different types of ITCs, derived from aliphatic and aromatic GSLs, offer plant protection against several pathogens when used as a natural pesticide. For example, application of the aliphatic allyl ITC hydrolysis product of the 2-propenyl GSL (sinigrin) provides control of potato cyst nematodes (Pinto et al.; Aires et al.), soil-borne phytopathogenic fungi (Tiznado-Hernandez and Troncoso-Rojas), mealy cabbage aphid colonies (Newton et al.), and beneficial soil invertebrates (Zuluaga et al.). The natural toxic properties of ITCs make them useful as a more sustainable alternative to chemical fumigants in agricultural practices.The aliphatic GSL biosynthetic pathway has been widely studied and described in Arabidopsis thaliana, including the identification of regulatory factors and structural genes involved in the process. Upon genome sequencing, putative orthologues of the A. thaliana genes have been found in B. rapa (Wang et al.) and B. oleracea (Yi et al.). For instance, BoGSL-ALK, the homolog of the A. thaliana AtAOP2 gene, encodes a 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase, essential for the conversion of methylsulfinylalkyl GSLs to their alkenyl forms, therefore being one of the major genes controlling the glucoraphanin content in Brassica crops. In B. rapa all three BrAOP2 paralogues are active but have functionally diverged, BrAOP2.1 showed a slightly different pattern of expression in below-ground tissue at the seedling stage and in the silique at the reproductive stage compared with BrAOP2.2 and BrAOP2.3 genes (Zhang et al.). Heterologous expression and in vitro enzyme assays and Arabidopsis mutant complementation studies showed that all three BrAOP2 genes encode functional BrAOP2 proteins that convert the precursor methylsulfinyl alkyl glucosinolate to the alkenyl form (Zhang et al.). Brassica oleracea var. italica (broccoli) is known to contain a high concentration of glucoraphanin compared to other B. oleracea varieties, whereas sinigrin is only present in negligible concentrations, or even absent (Rangkadilok et al.). Li and Quiros found that the accumulation of methylsulfinylalkyl GSLs in broccoli is linked to the presence of a non-functional allele of BoGSL-ALK in this crop. Therefore, the allelic variation for this BoAOP2 homolog is a key element for defining the potential health promoting effect of B. oleracea genotypes. The analysis of full-length cDNA libraries of kale, B. oleracea var. acephala, allowed to identify several genes related to the GSL biosynthetic pathway in this crop, including the transcription factor BoMYB29, the functional orthologue of the A. thaliana MYB29 gene controlling the expression of GSL biosynthesis genes (Araki et al.).The hypothesis behind this work is that BoMYB29 is one of the key transcription factors that controls expression of AGSL biosynthesis genes; upregulation of this transcription factor may be obtained through ectopic overexpression, which can increase the expression of AGSL biosynthesis genes and consequently the concentrations of one or several AGSL, including those that are human or plant health promoting. To verify this hypothesis, we correlated AGLS content to the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of these compounds in wild and cultivated B. oleracea genotypes, and performed a functional analysis of the BoMYB29 gene. Two genotypes showing a different AGLS profile were transformed with BoMYB29 driven by the CaMV 35S promoter and transgenic plants were analysed for gene expression and AGLS production. The antigenotoxic activity of the BoMYB29 overexpressing plants was evaluated by assessing the potential of plant extracts to protect human colon cancer HT29 cells from DNA damage. The results obtained in this work provide useful information for breeding programmes focused on improving health-promoting properties of B. oleracea or anti-herbivore traits.", "results": "ResultsAliphatic glucosinolate production in B. oleracea genotypes correlates with the expression of glucosinolate biosynthesis genesIn order to evaluate whether the content of AGSLs in the different genotypes analysed was correlated to gene expression, the four Winspit plants plus the PSB and SAV cultivars were used to perform HPLC analyses, microarray and qRT-PCR transcription profiling assays. Profiles and quantities of AGSLs differed between leaves of Winspit and the cultivated PSB and SAV lines. Although variation was observed among Winspit individuals, in general the wild genotypes displayed a higher AGSL concentration compared to the two crops, particularly for the alkenyl-GSLs gluconapin (GNP) and sinigrin (SIN) (Fig. 1a, Table S3). In particular, WIN7 showed the highest concentration of GNP and SIN compared to all other genotypes. The striking differences in GSL levels among the examined plant material might be due to differences in either expression or function of genes involved in GSL biosynthesis. To determine gene expression, leaf material of all genotypes was used for Affymetrix Brassica Exon 1.0 ST microarray hybridisation. The results of the microarray assay were used to perform a Principle Component Analysis (PCA) (Fig. S1), showing that the three B. oleracea types differed from each other with respect to overall gene expression. As expected, WIN plants were more heterogeneous than both the F1 hybrid cultivars and, on the whole, more similar to SAV than to PSB plants. When the combined WIN expression data were compared to the two cultivars, 656 probe sets were significantly differentially expressed between WIN and PSB and 699 probe sets between WIN and SAV. In total, 170 probe sets were significantly differentially expressed between WIN and both PSB and SAV (Table S4). Gene Ontology analysis of these differentially expressed genes revealed that GO terms related to 'mucilage metabolism and extrusion', 'seed coat development' and 'seedling development' were significantly overrepresented in the WIN genotypes (Table S5).In order to specifically analyse genes of the GLS pathways, a panel of 216 probe sets, representing genes that were previously considered to be relevant for GSL biosynthesis (Wang et al.), was examined for differential expression between WIN plants and the two cultivars (Fig. S2). Four GSL genes were significantly differentially expressed between WIN and PSB: BoGSL-OH (Bra021670, predicted to encode a 2-oxoacid dependent dioxygenase) and BoIPMI SSU2 (Bra004744, predicted to encode an isopropylmalate dehydratase) were both down-regulated in WIN, while BoGSTF9 (Bra022815, predicted to encode glutathione S-transferase phi9) and BoST5a (Bra008132, predicted to encode desulfoglucosinolate sulfotransferase 5a) were both up-regulated in WIN. The same genes, except for BoGSTF9, were differentially expressed between WIN and SAV.The number of genes differentially expressed between each Winspit line and the cultivars varies. Three probe sets (rres089630.v1_st, Bra023450; rres017223.v1_st, Bra021670; rres045980.v1_x_st, Bra021670) were found to be consistently differentially expressed between WIN7 and the other genotypes. Of these genes, Bra023450 was up-regulated (3.5 vs. SAV, 5.2 vs. PSB), while Bra021670 was down-regulated. Similar results were obtained for WIN5 (three probe sets) and WIN9 (five probe sets). Of these probe sets, two were consistently differentially expressed in all WIN lines compared to the cultivated plants: Bra023450 (rres089630.v1_st) encoding a 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase and Bra021670 (rres017223.v1_st) encoding a putative dioxygenase, were up-regulated and down-regulated in WIN, respectively.To complement the microarray analysis and to study the B. oleracea AGSL pathway in more detail, expression of different AGSL genes identified in B. rapa and B. oleracea (Li and Quiros; Gao et al.; Wang et al.) was determined by qRT-PCR analysis. In addition, expression of the different paralogues of those genes, which may not have been distinguished by microarray analysis, was assessed. Altogether, the expression of 42 AGSL biosynthesis pathway genes was assessed (Fig. 1b). The difference in AGSL production in the B. oleracea genotypes used in this study showed a positive correlation with the expression of BoMYB29 and BoMYB28 transcription factor genes and BoBCAT4(1), BoGSL-PRO, BoCYP79F1, BoSUR1, BoST5b(3), BoFMOGS-OX(5) and BoAOP2(2) structural genes (Table 1). The high AGSL containing genotype, WIN7 showed the highest relative expression of these genes. In contrast, both cultivars and WIN14, which displayed low AGSL production, also showed low expression of the above-mentioned genes.MYB29 from Winspit regulates the expression of several genes in B. oleraceaAlthough the AGSL concentrations in the WIN genotypes were naturally high, we wanted to investigate if overexpression of one of the transcriptional regulators of the AGSL pathway could increase the AGSL leaf content to even higher levels. Among the key regulators whose expression was positively and significantly correlated with AGSL content, we chose BoMYB29(2) since its expression in the different genotypes used in this study showed the same trend as the expression of BoAOP2 (Fig. 1), a gene crucial for the synthesis of Alkenyl-GSL. Therefore, we cloned the WIN7 MYB29(2) gene (BoMYB29) by RT-PCR from RNA and constructed an A. tumefaciens vector under the control of the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter. The DH AG1012 genotype, which can be easily transformed (Sparrow et al.), and plants of the wild B. oleracea accession Winspit, were genetically modified using the Pro35S::BoMYB29 construct. Six and two independent transformants were obtained from DH AG1012 and from Winspit, respectively. Preliminary phenotypic data did not show any difference in AGSL type and concentration between WT and EV plants. Therefore, WT plants growing at the same environmental conditions as the BoMYB29 transgenic lines were used as a control of the transformation.In order to evaluate the effect of BoMYB29(2) overexpression, we used the same Affymetrix Brassica Exon 1.0 ST microarray as above. The expression levels of GSL biosynthesis related genes, consisting of 216 probe sets, representing 86 Brassica genes (Wang et al.), were assessed in the transformed DH and Winspit lines and compared to the WT plants. A profile plot and a hierarchical clustering showed that many GSL related genes are up-regulated and several other genes down-regulated in the DH BoMYB29-overexpressing lines, compared to the control plants (Fig. S3a, b). Out of the 216 GSL related probe sets, a group of 46, representing 24 genes, was consistently up-regulated in the transgenic lines DH3, DH5 and DH6 (Fig. S3b; Tables S6, S7). The same analysis was performed for the two transgenic Winspit lines, compared to the control plants. Hierarchical clustering analysis of the Winspit BoMYB29-overexpressing lines demonstrated that a smaller number of genes was up-regulated as compared to the DH BoMYB29 transgenic lines (Fig. S3c; Table S8). Only eleven probe sets (representing nine genes) were differentially expressed in W1, twenty probe sets in W2 (representing 16 genes), and eight probe sets (representing seven genes) were consistently differentially expressed in the two Winspit transgenic lines compared to the wild type.Quantitative qRT-PCR experiments were performed to confirm the microarray data. Expression of the 42 AGSL genes analysed previously was studied for the BoMYB29 transgenic lines and their respective WT backgrounds. BoMYB29 was highly up-regulated in all transformants, especially in the DH lines (Fig. 2a). For the DH AG1012 BoMYB29 overexpression lines, at least one paralogue of each of the 42 genes analysed was up-regulated in the transgenics compared to the WT, while BoST5b (gene 5) and BoMYB28 (genes 1 and 2) were the only genes that did not display an up-regulation in the transgenic lines. BoBCAT4 (genes 1 and 2), BoGSL-ELONG and BoST5c were highly up-regulated (Fig. 2a). Other genes with > 20-fold up-regulation in DH AG1012 transgenic lines were BoCYP79F1(1), BoCYP83A1(2), BoSUR1(1), BoUGT74C1(1), BoST5B(1), BoFMOGS-OX2, BoGSL-OH(2), BoBZO1p(2). Winspit overexpressing lines displayed less activity of the transgene compared to the DH tranformants. In fact, in the Winspit transgenic plants just a few GSL genes displayed an up-regulation due to the overexpression of MYB29. Among the genes highly expressed in the Winspit overexpressing lines are BoBCAT4(1), BoBCAT3(2) and BoSUR1(2) with more than two times up-regulation in W1 compared to the respective WT. In general, BoBCAT4 and BoBAT5, encoding the sodium symporter protein 5, were the strongest expressed genes among the up-regulated ones in the overexpressing lines.BoMYB29 overexpression increases the AGSL production in B. oleracea plantsThe overexpression of BoMYB29 did not only induce the overexpression of several GSL related genes, but also led to higher levels of AGSLs in the transgenic B. oleracea plants, when compared to their WT control plants (Figs. 2b, S4; Table S3). As for the DH AG1012 BoMYB29 transgenics, a higher production of methylsulphinylalkyl-GSLs compared to the WT plants was observed. The expression of several genes showed a significant correlation (p < 0.01) with the production of methylsulphinylalkyl-GSLs (Table 2). For instance, the expression of BoBCAT4(2), BoGSL-Elong, BoSUR1(1), BoUGT74B1, BoUGT74C1(1) and BoST5c genes was significantly correlated with the production of glucoraphanin in the overexpressing plants, while the expression of BoBCAT3(1), BoCYP83A1(2), BoST5b(3) was correlated with both glucoraphanin and glucoiberin production.On the other hand, in the BoMYB29 overexpressing Winspit lines, high levels of alkenyl-GSLs were found, while no methylsulphinylalkyl-GSLs could be detected, suggesting that all the methylsulphinylalkyl-GSLs were converted into alkenyl-GSLs (Fig. 2b). The two Winspit overexpressing lines contained significantly more 2-propenyl/allyl (sinigrin) and butenyl GSL (gluconapin), as well as total AGSL levels, than their control. The total GSL content was positively and significantly correlated with the expression of the BoBCAT3(2) gene in Winspit transgenic lines (Table 2). Conversely, DH AG1012 plants produced methylsulphinylalkyl-GSLs and no alkenyl-GSL form (Fig. S4). Amplification and sequencing of the DH AG1012 BoGS-ALK (BoAOP2) gene, encoding the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase involved in this biochemical conversion, showed the presence of a 2-bp deletion in exon 2 of BoAOP2 paralogues, as it was previously shown by Gao et al. in broccoli.DH6 GSL extract produces a protective effect against H2O2-induced DNA damageThe chemopreventive properties of B. oleracea plant extracts were tested by assessing their potential to protect human colon HT29 cells from DNA damage by hydrogen peroxide, a proven genotoxic compound. For this assay, we used the wild type DH-WT1 and the transgenic line DH6, showing the highest GSL content among the obtained transformants. The Comet assay (single-cell gel electrophoresis) is a simple method for measuring DNA strand breaks in eukaryotic cells (Collins). Comet assay experiments performed without addition of hydrogen peroxide showed that the plant extracts did not induce DNA damage themselves as there was no difference in baseline DNA damage after 24 h incubation with plant extracts compared to incubation with serum-free medium (control) (Repeated Measures ANOVA with Tukey's post hoc test, p = 0.074) (Fig. 3). Incubating the control sample with hydrogen peroxide led to the induction of considerable DNA damage (Tail fluorescence intensity: 19.2 +- 4.1% mean +- SD Tail DNA) (Fig. 3). Analysis with Repeated Measures ANOVA revealed that results for hydrogen peroxide induced DNA damage differed significantly according to treatment (p = 0.0002). Tukey's post hoc test showed that while incubation for 24 h with wild-type extracts had no effect on DNA strand breaks induced by hydrogen peroxide, incubation with DH6 and DH-WT1 GSL extracts significantly reduced DNA damage compared to the control sample (p < 0.01, p < 0.01 and p < 0.001 for 10 microg/mL, 100 microg/mL and 1000 microg/mL fresh weight of transgenic plant extracts compared to serum-free medium, respectively). Extracts from the DH6 transgenic line were also significantly more effective in preventing DNA strand breaks than the DH-WT1 extracts at the respective concentrations (p < 0.05 for 10 microg/mL DH6 vs. DH-WT1, 100 microg/mL DH6 vs. DH-WT1 and 1000 microg/mL DH6 vs. DH-WT1)."}, "34374201": {"doi": "10.1111/mpp.13096", "title": "Extra-large G-proteins influence plant response to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum by regulating glucosinolate metabolism in Brassica juncea ", "abstract": "AbstractHeterotrimeric G-proteins are one of the highly conserved signal transducers across phyla. Despite the obvious importance of G-proteins in controlling various plant growth and environmental responses, there is no information describing the regulatory complexity of G-protein networks during pathogen response in a polyploid crop. Here, we investigated the role of extra-large G-proteins (XLGs) in the oilseed crop Brassica juncea, which has inherent susceptibility to the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. The allotetraploid B. juncea genome contains multiple homologs of three XLG genes (two BjuXLG1, five BjuXLG2, and three BjuXLG3), sharing a high level of sequence identity, gene structure organization, and phylogenetic relationship with the progenitors' orthologs. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR analysis revealed that BjuXLGs have retained distinct expression patterns across plant developmental stages and on S. sclerotiorum infection. To determine the role of BjuXLG genes in the B. juncea defence response against S. sclerotiorum, RNAi-based suppression was performed. Disease progression analysis showed more rapid lesion expansion and fungal accumulation in BjuXLG-RNAi lines compared to the vector control plants, wherein suppression of BjuXLG3 homologs displayed more compromised defence response at the later time point. Knocking down BjuXLGs caused impairment of the host resistance mechanism to S. sclerotiorum, as indicated by reduced expression of defence marker genes PDF1.2 and WRKY33 on pathogen infection. Furthermore, BjuXLG-RNAi lines showed reduced accumulation of leaf glucosinolates on S. sclerotiorum infection, wherein aliphatic glucosinolates were significantly compromised. Overall, our data suggest that B. juncea XLG genes are important signalling nodes modulating the host defence pathways in response to this necrotrophic pathogen.The Brassica juncea XLG genes play distinct roles in defence against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum through altered expression of defence pathway genes and leaf glucosinolates accumulation.  ", "intro": "INTRODUCTIONSignal transduction is one of the important biological processes through which organisms perceive extracellular stimuli and transmit it intracellularly. Heterotrimeric G-proteins (G-proteins), consisting of G-alpha (Galpha), G-beta (Gbeta), and G-gamma (Ggamma) subunits, are a class of signal transducers conserved across eukaryotes. The model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana has a limited set of core G-protein subunits, with a canonical Galpha and Gbeta, together with three Ggamma subunits (Urano et al.,). The Arabidopsis genome additionally encodes three extra-large Galpha-like proteins (XLGs), namely, XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3 (Ding et al.,; Lee & Assmann,). XLGs are twice as large as the canonical Galpha protein, which led to their terminology as extra-large GTP binding proteins. The C-terminal region of XLGs shows structural homology to canonical Galpha proteins; however, their N-terminal region is quite distinct (Ding et al.,). Despite the differences, XLGs show physical interaction with all three possible Gbetagamma dimers at the plasma membrane (Chakravorty et al.,; Heo et al.,; Maruta et al.,). XLGs thus represent additional nodes in plant G-protein signalling, having multiple roles during plant development and stress responses (Ding et al.,; Maruta et al.,; Pandey,; Urano et al.,).Various studies using inhibitors, agonists, and loss-of-function mutants suggest the role of G-protein signalling in plant defence (Trusov et al.,; Urano et al.,; Zhong et al.,). In general, a higher susceptibility response to bacterial and fungal pathogens was observed in the Arabidopsis Gbeta-null mutant (agb1), xlg123-triple mutant, and Ggamma triple mutant (agg123), but not in the null mutant of the canonical Galpha (gpa1) and Col-0 wild type, indicating that biotic stress responses are biased towards XLGs rather than canonical Galpha (Urano et al.,). The expression of XLG2 and XLG3 genes was found to be rapidly induced by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae, whereas XLG1 transcription was not affected (Ding et al.,). Studies in Arabidopsis demonstrated that XLGs are positive regulators of resistance to the biotrophic pathogen P. syringae, which largely triggers the salicylic acid (SA)-responsive pathway; however, no significant difference was observed for the necrotrophic fungi Alternaria brassicicola and Botrytis cinerea, which trigger the jasmonic acid (JA)-responsive pathway (Maruta et al.,; Zhu et al.,). The xlg2 mutation leads to compromised induction of pathogen-responsive (PR1 and PR2) genes during infected conditions. In addition, XLG-mediated resistance against hemibiotrophic fungi and bacteria is associated with receptor-like kinases (RLKs) and the defence mechanism is based upon the activation of programmed cell death (PCD). The Arabidopsis XLGs thus have distinct functions in disease resistance through their interaction with the Gbetagamma dimer (Zhong et al.,).The genus Brassica is economically the most important genus of the Cruciferae family, crops of which are used for human nutrition as vegetables, oilseeds, and condiments. The inherent susceptibility of Brassica species to biotic stresses is a major factor that has limited their productivity in recent decades. Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, the causal agent of sclerotinia stem rot in Brassica crops, causes extensive (40%-80%) yield losses worldwide (Sharma et al.,) and has proved hard to control, with host resistance being insufficient. The persistence of this fungus is due to its sclerotia, which remain viable under adverse conditions and can be retained in soil for many years (Brustolin et al.,). This aggressive fungus is known to hijack plant defence by modulating a wide range of signalling cascades, defence phytohormones, and stress-associated metabolites (Liang & Rollins,; Novakova et al.,). Recent reports in A. thaliana and Brassica species have established the key role of glucosinolates and their hydrolysis products against the necrotrophic pathogen S. sclerotiorum (Abuyusuf et al.,; Augustine & Bisht,; Chen et al.,; Hopkins et al.,; Sotelo et al.,).Brassica species have polyploid genomes, serving as an excellent crop model to study genome evolution and trait domestication (Augustine et al.,). We earlier reported that the mesohexaploid genomes of Brassica rapa and Brassica nigra contain multiple homologs of G-protein genes, which show distinct expression patterns in response to defence phytohormones and conditions mimicking biotic stress, suggesting putative involvement of G-protein signalling in plant defence (Arya et al.,; Kumar et al.,). There is a growing consensus that the signalling molecules, particularly JA, SA, and ethylene (ET), interact in complex ways to fine-tune plant defence metabolites, including glucosinolate accumulation (Augustine & Bisht,; Mewis et al.,). At the core of our study is the hypothesis that XLGs could be the key signalling determinant in the plant's response to S. sclerotiorum, possibly by modulating the defence pathways and stress-associated metabolites. Here, we report identification of multiple homologs of XLG-encoding genes from the allotetraploid B. juncea and its progenitors, which are shaped by whole-genome duplication and triplication events (Augustine et al.,). Using a series of molecular genetic and metabolite analyses, we demonstrated that specific silencing of B. juncea XLG homologs led to an altered susceptibility against S. sclerotiorum infection, which was further correlated with the altered expression of defence pathway genes and glucosinolate accumulation during pathogen infection. Our study is a novel endeavour to delineate the XLG-mediated defence strategy in plants against S. sclerotiorum.", "results": "RESULTSIdentification and evolution of B. juncea XLG-encoding genesWe first investigated the inventory and molecular evolution of XLG genes in the polyploid Brassica species. Using AtXLG1-3 protein sequences as reference queries on the publicly available databases, multiple XLG-like sequences were retrieved from the allotetraploid B. juncea (AB genome) and its progenitors, namely, B. rapa (A genome) and B. nigra (B genome). The diploid B. rapa and B. nigra genomes contain one XLG1, three XLG2, and two XLG3 sequences each (Table 1). Subsequently, a total of two XLG1, five XLG2, and three XLG3 sequences could be identified in B. juncea; the A and B subgenome-specific homologs could be ascertained using the B. rapa and B. nigra gene sequences. The XLG genes identified in this study were named following the nomenclature adopted for Brassica genes (Ostergaard & King,).The full-length coding sequence of Brassica XLGs ranged from 2,448 to 2,604 bp, encoding functional proteins of 816-868 amino acids (Table 1). Sequence alignment of the coding sequences revealed that the Brassica XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3 homologs shared 91.1%-98.3%, 58.5%-98.4%, and 82.8%-99.2% identity within respective group members (Table S1). As expected, the B. juncea XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3 genes shared a high sequence identity (>92.8%) with their corresponding B. rapa and B. nigra orthologs. Furthermore, analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences revealed that BjuXLG1, BjuXLG2, and BjuXLG3 proteins shared 84.0%-85.8%, 61.0%-75.9%, and 87.7%-88.9% identity with their corresponding AtXLG1, AtXLG2, and AtXLG3 proteins (Table 1). The BjuXLG proteins contain the predicted nuclear localization signal (NLS) and Cys-rich domains at the N-terminal region, while their C-terminal region harbours the signature sequences of the five characteristic domains (G1-G5) required for guanine nucleotide binding (Figure S1; Ding et al.,).The presence of multiple XLG-like sequences in the extant Brassica species led us to investigate the evolution of the XLG gene family by analysing their genomic structure and phylogenetic relationship. Analysis of genomic structure (http://gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn/) showed that the XLG genes contain six to eight exons (Figure 1a). In comparison, the introns in XLG genes were highly divergent in their sizes and sequences, suggesting independent evolution and expansion of XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3 genes in the Brassica lineage. To get a better insight into the expansion of the XLG gene family, a phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the multiple sequence alignment of full-length protein sequences identified from Brassica species and their A. thaliana counterparts. Phylogenetic analysis showed that XLG proteins from the four plant genomes were clustered into distinct XLG1, XLG2, and XLG3 classes (Figure 1b). Within each class, the B. juncea XLG proteins were grouped with their closest B. rapa (A) and B. nigra (B) orthologs, supported by high bootstrap values. Notably, the higher branch lengths of XLG2 proteins on the phylogenetic tree suggest that the XLG2 proteins have diverged more compared to XLG1 and XLG3 proteins. Furthermore, analysis of synteny in the BRAD database (http://brassicadb.org/brad/) showed that XLG2 homologs are retained in all three triplicated (least, moderately, and most fractionized) subgenomes, whereas homologs of XLG1 and XLG3 have experienced gene fractionation following the whole-genome triplication event in the diploid Brassica species (Table S2). Overall, the whole-genome triplication and gene fractionation (gene loss) events unique to the Brassica lineage have shaped both quantitative and structural divergence of the XLG genes.Expression profiling of B. juncea XLG genes during plant developmental stages and in response to S. sclerotiorum infectionThe three XLG genes of Arabidopsis display distinct spatiotemporal expression patterns during plant development (Figure S2). The multiplicity of XLG genes led us towards determining their expression patterns in B. juncea. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis suggested that the BjuXLG genes were ubiquitously expressed and showed distinct expression patterns in tissue types representing different developmental stages. The expression patterns of the two BjuXLG1 homologs were similar across the tested tissue types, although the abundance of BjuXLG1-B1 was higher than BjuXLG1-A1 (Figure 2a). The BjuXLG3 homologs also showed distinct expression patterns, wherein BjuXLG3-B2 was the most abundant transcript across the tested tissue types. However, in comparison to the BjuXLG1 and BjuXLG3 genes, the BjuXLG2 homologs had in general lower, yet distinct expression patterns during the plant developmental stages. Among the six BjuXLG2 homologs, expression of only four genes could be detected, whereas the expression of BjuXLG2-A2 and BjuXLG2-B2 transcripts was found to be negligible in all the tested tissue types (Figure 2a). BjuXLG2-A1 showed higher expression in the seedling stage. Notably, for each of the BjuXLG genes, the B subgenome-specific homologs showed a higher transcript accumulation compared to their A subgenome counterparts. This overlapping and distinct tissue-specific expression pattern of multiple homologs suggests spatiotemporal regulation of XLG genes in B. juncea.Furthermore, to determine whether B. juncea XLGs function in the defence response, cotyledons were inoculated with S. sclerotiorum isolate Delhi1 (SSD1) and the expression pattern of the BjuXLG genes was analysed using RT-qPCR at different time points (3-48 hr postinoculation [hpi]). The expression of BjuXLG genes was found to be altered differentially during SSD1 infection (Figure 2b). In general, both BjuXLG1 homologs showed significant downregulation at different time points of infection. In contrast, BjuXLG2 homologs exhibited increased transcript accumulation during SSD1 infection at one or more time points. For example, BjuXLG2-B1 and BjuXLG2-A3 were upregulated at as early as 3 hpi, BjuXLG2-A3 at 12 hpi, and all BjuXLG2 homologs showed a strong up-regulation at 24 hpi. Among the four BjuXLG3 homologs, BjuXLG3-B2 showed strong upregulation at 24 hpi, whereas BjuXLG3-A1, BjuXLG3-A2, and BjuXLG3-B2 homologs were upregulated at the later stages of infection (48 hpi). Overall, these results suggest a possible involvement of BjuXLG2 and BjuXLG3 during S. sclerotiorum infection in B. juncea.Development and molecular analysis of knockdown lines of B. juncea XLG genesTo study the roles of BjuXLG genes during pathogenesis of S. sclerotiorum isolate Delhi-1 (SSD1), intron-spliced hairpin RNAi (hpRNAi) constructs, independently targeting the BjuXLG1, BjuXLG2, and BjuXLG3 genes, driven by the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter were developed (Figures 3a and S3; Table S3). A large number of B. juncea T0 transformants were generated using Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation of hpRNAi constructs targeting BjuXLG genes along with the vector control (VC) construct (Table 2).To minimize any variation caused due to copy-number and cosuppression of the inserted transgene, only T0 events showing single-copy integration were selected. Basta (active ingredient glufosinate) segregation analysis in the germinated T1 progeny (3 resistant:1 susceptible) identified single-copy events for each construct, which were propagated until the T2 generation (Table S4). The downregulation of BjuXLG1, BjuXLG2, and BjuXLG3 homologs in single-copy transgenic lines was analysed in 5-day-old T2 seedlings through RT-qPCR using homolog-specific primers (Table S5). Expression analysis showed variable levels of downregulation of different BjuXLG homologs in the selected single-copy transgenic lines. Among the tested BjuXLG1-RNAi lines, 1#13 and 1#16 showed approximately 20%-70% decrease of BjuXLG1 homologs compared to the VC (set at 1) (Figure 3b). Similarly, the expression of most of the BjuXLG2 homologs was downregulated from 20% to 80% in BjuXLG2-RNAi lines 2#3, 2#11, and 2#21 as compared to the VC (Figure 3c). In BjuXLG3-RNAi lines (3#3, 3#7, and 3#13), expression of BjuXLG3 homologs was found to be downregulated 10%-60% compared to the VC (Figure 3d). Our results clearly show that there was a great deal of variation in silencing efficiency between transgenic lines and the target gene homologs in B. juncea.Disease response of B. juncea XLG-RNAi lines during infection of S. sclerotiorum We further investigated the effect of XLG silencing in B. juncea on infection by S. sclerotiorum. Two independent single-copy BjuXLG-RNAi lines showing comparable transcript downregulation of the respective homologs of BjuXLG1 (1#13, 1#16), BjuXLG2 (2#11, 2#21), and BjuXLG3 (3#7, 3#13) were selected. True leaves from T2 homozygous lines, along with VC plants, were used for inoculation with SSD1 mycelial plugs and the disease progression was compared from 24 to 48 hpi.Disease progression analysis showed a visible lesion size difference between transgenic lines and VC plants, which was apparent at 24 and 36 hpi and reached a maximum at 48 hpi (Figure 4a), suggesting that B. juncea XLG knockdown lines showed more rapid lesion expansion as compared to the VC plants. At 24 hpi, all the tested BjuXLG1-RNAi, BjuXLG2-RNAi, and BjuXLG3-RNAi lines displayed significantly larger lesion size (p < 0.05) compared to the VC plants. However, at later time points (36 and 48 hpi), the lesion size in BjuXLG3-RNAi lines was significantly higher than the BjuXLG1-RNAi, BjuXLG2-RNAi, and VC plants (Figure 4a,b). Thus, plants with suppression of BjuXLG1 and BjuXLG2 displayed enhanced disease susceptibility phenotype at the early stages of infection, whereas plants with BjuXLG3 suppression showed a susceptible disease response throughout the SSD1 infection.The hyphal growth of S. sclerotiorum in the infected leaf tissue was also examined by trypan blue staining at 24 hpi (Figure 5a). BjuXLG-RNAi lines infected with SSD1 showed intense blue staining and the mycelial growth was densely arranged as compared to the VC plants. Additionally, quantitative fungal colonization on the inoculated leaves was also compared using the RT-qPCR analysis. The expression of the S. sclerotiorum housekeeping gene Histone was significantly higher on BjuXLG1-RNAi, BjuXLG2-RNAi, and BjuXLG3-RNAi lines compared to the VC plants (Figure 5b). These results indicate a positive role of XLG genes in mitigating S. sclerotiorum infection in B. juncea.Expression of defence marker genes in B. juncea XLG-RNAi lines during infection of S. sclerotiorum To investigate whether the suppression of B. juncea XLG genes leads to expression changes in defence-marker genes, we examined the transcription abundance of the commonly used PDF1.2 (JA pathway) and PR-1 (SA pathway) genes using RT-qPCR (Table S5). During the noninfected (mock) condition, the abundance of the selected defence-marker genes in the XLG-RNAi lines was found to be comparable to the vector control plants (Figure S4). The expression of these defence-marker genes was analysed in SSD1-infected leaf samples at 24 hpi, and the fold change was compared with mock plants (set at 1). The upregulation of PDF1.2 was significantly compromised in BjuXLG-RNAi lines compared to the VC plants, showing c.90-fold transcript upregulation (Figure 6a). In contrast, expression of PR-1 was not altered in the BjuXLG-RNAi lines and VC plants during SSD1-infected conditions (Figure 6b), suggesting that S. sclerotiorum infection follows an SA-independent route in plants.The mRNA accumulation of another defence marker gene, WRKY33, regulating phytoalexin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (Mao et al.,), was also evaluated. A few earlier reports have documented the key role of WRKY33 in resistance against S. sclerotiorum in oilseed rape, B. napus, possibly by activation of JA- and SA-mediated defence response (Liu et al,; Wang et al.,). In comparison to the VC plants, the BjuXLG-RNAi lines showed comparably lower upregulation of WRKY33 during SSD1 infection, wherein a significant inhibition of WRKY33 transcription was observed for the BjuXLG3-RNAi lines (Figure 6c). The altered expression of the key defence marker genes (WRKY33 and PDF1.2) in BjuXLG-RNAi lines during SSD1 infection indicates a direct role of B. juncea XLG genes in the S. sclerotiorum defence response.Glucosinolate accumulation in B. juncea XLG-RNAi lines during S. sclerotiorum infectionBecause Brassica species possess high amounts of specialized defence metabolites, glucosinolates, we were curious to investigate if suppression of XLG genes in B. juncea had any effects on glucosinolate levels. Glucosinolate content and composition was estimated at an initial time point of SSD1 infection in intact leaves of BjuXLG1-RNAi, BjuXLG2-RNAi, and BjuXLG3-RNAi lines (Table S6). The most abundant glucosinolates in B. juncea leaves were those belonging to the aliphatic glucosinolates (allyl/sinigrin, 3-butenyl, and 4-pentenyl), whereas indolic (4OH-I3M [4-hydroxyindol-3-ylmethyl], I3M [indol-3-ylmethyl], and 4MO-I3M [4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl]) glucosinolates were present in minor fractions. The concentration of aliphatic glucosinolates in the VC line was found to be 96.77 +- 0.06 micromol/g dry weight (DW) in mock condition, which increased to 108.29 +- 6.43 micromol/g DW at an early time point (3 hpi) of pathogen infection (Table S6 and Figure 7a). We observed that the accumulation of aliphatic glucosinolates in BjuXLG-RNAi lines was significantly lower than in the VC plants in both infected and mock plants. It was noteworthy that the accumulation of aliphatic glucosinolates in the BjuXLG1-RNAi, BjuXLG2-RNAi (except 2#11), and BjuXLG3-RNAi lines showed marked reduction of leaf glucosinolates after SSD1 infection, with silencing of BjuXLG3 providing a more drastic effect. The altered defence response of the BjuXLG-RNAi lines thus seems to have resulted from the altered accumulation of aliphatic glucosinolates (Figure 7a). However, the levels of indolic glucosinolates in mock and SSD1-inoculated plants did not change among BjuXLG-RNAi lines and VC plants (Table S6).To investigate the effect of plant type (vector control and BjuXLG-RNAi lines) and treatments (mock and SSD1 infection) on the alteration of aliphatic, indolic, and total glucosinolates, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed. The analysis indicated that plant type had significant impact on the levels of all glucosinolates, whereas the effect of treatment was significant for aliphatic and total glucosinolates (Table 3). The interaction between plant type and treatment further suggested that aliphatic glucosinolates had a predominant effect during the B. juncea-SSD1 interaction. We examined the correlation between the disease severity (lesion size) of B. juncea XLG-RNAi lines and aliphatic glucosinolate content during both noninfected and postinfection conditions. Using the simple linear model, lesion size showed a positive correlation with leaf aliphatic glucosinolate content of the noninfected VC as well as BjuXLG-RNAi (except BjuXLG1-RNAi) lines (Figure 7b). However, the lesion size of BjuXLG-RNAi showed a negative correlation with leaf aliphatic glucosinolate after SSD1 infection, which was in contrast to the VC plants (Figure 7c). Furthermore, BjuXLG2-RNAi lines had a more profound effect on lesion size in response to S. sclerotiorum infection. Overall, our data indicated that the knockdown of B. juncea XLG genes leads to differential alteration of leaf glucosinolate accumulation vis-a-vis altered susceptibility against the necrotrophic pathogen S. sclerotiorum."}, "34997255": {"doi": "10.1007/s00204-021-03216-8", "title": "Feeding Brassica vegetables to rats leads to the formation of characteristic DNA adducts (from 1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl glucosinolate) in many tissues", "abstract": "Juices of Brassica vegetables are mutagenic and form characteristic DNA adducts in bacteria and mammalian cells. In this study, we examined whether such adducts are also formed in vivo in animal models. Rats fed raw broccoli ad libitum in addition to normal laboratory chow for 5 weeks showed one major adduct spot and sometimes an additional minor adduct spot in liver, kidney, lung, blood and the gastrointestinal tract, as determined by 32P-postlabelling/thin-layer chromatography. Adducts with the same chromatographic properties were formed when herring sperm DNA (or dG-3'-phosphate) was incubated with 1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl glucosinolate (phytochemical present in Brassica plants), in the presence of myrosinase (plant enzyme that hydrolyses glucosinolates to bioactive breakdown products). UPLC-MS/MS analysis corroborated this finding: 1-Methoxy-3-indolylmethyl-substituted purine nucleosides were detected in the hepatic DNA of broccoli-fed animals, but not in control animals. Feeding raw cauliflower led to the formation of the same adducts. When steamed rather than raw broccoli was used, the adduct levels were essentially unchanged in liver and jejunum, but elevated in large intestine. Due to inactivation of myrosinase by the steaming, higher levels of the glucosinolates may have reached the large bowl to be activated by glucosidases from intestinal bacteria. In conclusion, the consumption of common Brassica vegetables can lead to the formation of substantial levels of DNA adducts in animal models. The adducts can be attributed to a specific phytochemical, neoglucobrassicin (1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl glucosinolate).Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s00204-021-03216-8.", "intro": "IntroductionJuices of various Brassica vegetables have shown mutagenic activity in bacteria and mammalian cells in culture (Kassie et al.; Baasanjav-Gerber et al.; Wiesner et al.). This mutagenicity was associated with the formation of characteristic DNA adducts in the target cells (Baasanjav-Gerber et al.). Likewise, adducts with the endogenous DNA were formed when Brassicaceae vegetables were homogenised and then incubated at 37  C for 15 min to 16 h (Baasanjav-Gerber et al.). We demonstrated that these various genotoxic effects are mediated by breakdown products of glucosinolates (GLs) (Baasanjav-Gerber et al.; Wiesner et al.). These findings raised the question whether GLs may also form DNA adducts in vivo after the consumption of brassicaceous crops. To this end, we fed broccoli and cauliflower to rats and then analysed various rat tissues for GL-derived DNA adducts.This work was conducted some years ago. What is described in the preceding paragraph, reflects the stage of knowledge at the beginning of this study. However, in parallel to this study and afterwards, we performed and published other work on biological activities (genotoxicity, modulation of carcinogenesis, formation of protein adducts) and the bioactivation of GLs, in particular neoglucobrassicin (nGBS, 1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl glucosinolate) and glucoraphanin (4-methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolate). This work is outlined at the end of the discussion section under the heading \"Epilogue\".", "results": "ResultsConsumption of broccoli or cauliflower, intake of GLs and body weight developmentThe rats consumed 36 g broccoli per day and animal in the first experiment on average (details in Table S3). In the second experiment, the average daily Brassica consumption amounted to 48 g for raw broccoli, 47 g for steamed broccoli and 39 g for cauliflower (Table S8). GL levels in broccoli and cauliflower were regularly monitored (Tables S4 and S9), allowing calculation of their total intake in the experiments (Table 1; details in Tables S5, S10 and S11). The body weight development was similar in Brassica-fed and control rats (Tables S1 and S6).DNA adduct formation in tissues of rats fed broccoli or cauliflower32P-postlabelling analyses demonstrated the presence of one or two DNA adduct spots in 11 out of 13 tissues isolated from rats fed raw broccoli in experiment I (upper row of Fig. 1, Table 2). These adducts were absent in control animals (middle row of Fig. 1). Their chromatographic properties were similar to adduct spots 3 and 5 detected in the endogenous DNA of broccoli homogenate (lower row of Fig. 1).In the repeat experiment, two additional feed groups were used, one received steamed broccoli, the other received raw cauliflower. In this experiment, only four tissues were analysed for the presence of adducts, as the 32P-postlabelling analysis is very labour-intensive. All these tissues showed adduct spot 3 and sometimes also adduct spot 5 in each individual animal fed Brassica crops (Table 3); again, the adducts were absent in control rats. The adduct levels obtained in the raw-broccoli group in the gut were similar in both experiments. The hepatic adduct levels obtained in the raw-broccoli group in experiment II were somewhat higher than in experiment I (cf. Tables 2 and 3), although the total intake of GLs was similar (Table 1). However, profiles and levels of GLs differently varied over the feeding periods (Tables S4 and S9). Moreover, somewhat older animals were used in experiment II than in experiment I.Feeding of raw cauliflower led to the formation of the same adduct spots as feeding of raw broccoli, but adduct levels were somewhat lower:by a factor of 1.4 to 1.9 depending on the tissue (Table 3). This compares to a 3.2-fold lower intake of total GLs in the raw cauliflower compared to the raw-broccoli group (Table 1). However, profiles of GLs were somewhat different in these two varieties of Brassica oleracea (Table S9). When steamed rather than raw broccoli was used (Table 3), adduct levels were unchanged in the jejunum and the liver, but were enhanced nearly threefold in large bowl (Wilcoxon rank test p = 0.02 and 0.05 for caecum and colon mucosa, respectively). From previous work, we know that the steaming procedure used strongly reduces myrosinase activity in broccoli, as indicated by a decrease in the adduct formation in the homogenate by 90% (Baasanjav-Gerber et al.). Thus, it is likely that higher levels of GLs reached the large intestine when steamed rather than raw broccoli was used. There they were either activated by the residual myrosinase activity from broccoli (taking advantage from the long transit period in this part of the gut) or by glucosidases from intestinal bacteria.Characterisation of the adducts in rats fed broccoliPreviously, we demonstrated that adduct spot 3 in homogenates of brassicaceous plant material co-migrates with adducts formed in herring sperm DNA by a specific GL, nGBS (structure presented in Scheme 1) (Baasanjav-Gerber et al.). Using a total of eleven other GLs, no adduct was detected with comparable chromatographic properties (Baasanjav-Gerber et al.). In contrast, several different GLs, including nGBS, formed adducts with the chromatographic properties of spot 5. In subsequent experiments, nGBS and myrosinase were incubated with individual dN-3'-phosphates rather than DNA. The major adducts formed with dG- and dA-3'-phosphate migrated as the adduct spots 3 and 5, respectively (data not shown).Using co-chromatography techniques, we verified that the major adducts found in liver of a rat fed raw broccoli exactly chromatographs as the 1-MIM-dG adduct (Fig. 2). The signal of the second adduct was too faint for co-chromatography experiments.Using mass-spectrometric method, we demonstrated that 1-MIM-dG, 1-MIM-dA and 1-MIM-dC adducts were formed, when nGBS was incubated with herring sperm DNA in the presence of myrosinase (Schumacher et al.). The m/z ratios of the protonated dG and dA adducts as well as the major daughter ions are shown in Scheme 1. Two transitions were used for the UPLC-MS/MS analyses of each adduct. These analyses clearly demonstrated the presence of MIM-dG (Fig. 3) and MIM-dA (Fig. 4) adducts in hepatic DNA of broccoli-fed rats, but not in DNA of control rats. The MIM-dC adduct was not detected (data not shown) in vivo, which was not surprising in as much as the level of this adduct was very low in reference DNA reacted with activated nGBS (Schumacher et al.).Intake of nGBSAfter demonstrating that nGBS is involved in the formation of DNA adducts that were observed in rats fed Brassica vegetable, we calculated the intake of this GL in the different experimental groups, taking into account the consumption levels and the nGBS content in the different materials (Table 1, details in the Supporting Information). The mean daily nGBS intake ranged from 1.3 to 4.4 mg in the 17 rats receiving broccoli-containing diets and from 0.22 to 0.79 mg in the six rats receiving the cauliflower-containing diet (Table 1). The lower intake from cauliflower was reflected in lower DNA adduct levels (Table 3)."}, "35163500": {"doi": "10.3390/ijms23031577", "title": "The Cellular and Subcellular Organization of the Glucosinolate-Myrosinase System against Herbivores and Pathogens", "abstract": "Glucosinolates are an important class of secondary metabolites in Brassicales plants with a critical role in chemical defense. Glucosinolates are chemically inactive but can be hydrolyzed by myrosinases to produce a range of chemically active compounds toxic to herbivores and pathogens, thereby constituting the glucosinolate-myrosinase defense system or the mustard oil bomb. During the evolution, Brassicales plants have developed not only complex biosynthetic pathways for production of a large number of glucosinolate structures but also different classes of myrosinases that differ in catalytic mechanisms and substrate specificity. Studies over the past several decades have made important progress in the understanding of the cellular and subcellular organization of the glucosinolate-myrosinase system for rapid and timely detonation of the mustard oil bomb upon tissue damage after herbivore feeding and pathogen infection. Progress has also been made in understanding the mechanisms that herbivores and pathogens have evolved to counter the mustard oil bomb.

IntroductionPlants have a variety of inducible and constitutive mechanisms including chemical defenses to protect themselves against attack by pathogens and herbivores. Plant chemical defenses are associated with a vast array of antimicrobial and antiherbivory secondary metabolites, predominantly terpenoids, phenolics, and N-containing compounds (including alkaloids, cyanogenic glycosides, glucosinolates, and benzoxazinoids). In addition, some plants use fatty acid derivatives, amino acid, and even peptides as defense chemicals. Production of plant defense chemicals can be inducible or constitutive. For examples, some antimicrobial compounds are rapidly synthesized at infection sites in response to microbial pathogens and are usually referred to as phytoalexins. Phytoalexins are chemically diverse and broad-spectrum inhibitors of microbial organisms. By contrast, phytoanticipins are preformed antimicrobial compounds that are present in plants before attack by microorganisms or infection. Many of these antimicrobial chemicals are also effective against other types of organisms including herbivores and, therefore, the classification of defense chemicals can be broadened to include those that respond to insect pests. Plants also generate volatile organic compounds with major roles in plant communication with the surrounding organisms including microorganisms, pollinators, herbivores, and other natural enemies.Glucosinolates, which are widely distributed in the order Brassicales, are one of the most extensively analyzed classes of defense chemicals in plants (Figure 1). Upon tissue damage by pests, glucosinolates are hydrolyzed by thioglucoside glucohydrolases (TGGs) called myrosinases into unstable thiohydroximate- O-sulfonates, which can rearrange to form a range of hydrolytic products including isothiocyanates, nitriles, and other by-products toxic to herbivores, pathogens, and other organisms (Figure 1). This glucosinolate-myrosinase defense system is also known as \"mustard oil bomb\". Over the past two decades or so, important progress has been made in the analysis of the structural diversity of glucosinolates and their metabolites. More importantly, a great deal has been learned from the extensive research in the model plant Arabidopsis on the cellular and subcellular organization of the mustard oil bomb required for its rapid and timely activation upon tissue damage. Important information has also been gained on how some herbivores and pathogens disarm the mustard oil bomb or even exploit it for defense against predators. In the review, we discuss what we currently know, what questions remain, and how a better knowledge about the glucosinolate-myrosinase system, particularly about the diversity, function, spatial organization, and evolution of the components of the mustard oil bomb, can help in understanding the molecular and cellular basis of chemical defense in plants.2. The Glucosinolate-Myrosinase Chemical Defense SystemGlucosinolates are a well-defined class of metabolites produced by cabbages, mustards, and related plants in the Brassicales order. After hydrolysis, all glucosinolates have the potential to form isothiocyanates, the pungent constituent in domestic mustard with a sharp taste, and, therefore, are historically known as mustard oils. Glucosinolates are nitrogen-containing, sulfur-rich, amino acid-derived metabolites with a beta-d-glucopyranose unit linked through a sulfur atom to an N-hydroxyimino sulfate ester (Figure 1). Besides the beta-thioglucose and thiohydroximate-O-sulfonate compartments, glucosinolates contain a variable aglycone side chain derived from an alpha-amino acid, which can be either aliphatic, indole, or aromatic. Glucosinolates are synthesized from amino acids (alanine, leucine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosin, and valin) in three phases: chain elongation of precursor amino acids (especially methionine), formation of the glucosinolate core structure, and further side-chain modification. Most of the enzymes involved in the core structure biosynthesis have been identified and cloned in Arabidopsis, and it is possible now to engineer the production of glucosinolates in non-cruciferous organisms by transferring an entire glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway.Glucosinolates are usually stored in the vacuole in plant cells. Upon tissue damage after pest feeding or other mechanical disruption, glucosinolates are hydrolyzed by myrosinases into unstable thiohydroximate- O-sulfonates, which rearrange to form different hydrolytic products such as isothiocyanates, nitriles, and other by-products depending on the side chains of glucosinolates, the reaction conditions including iron and pH, and myrosinase interacting proteins (Figure 1). The toxic hydrolysis products of glucosinolates have a variety of biological activities in insect-plant interactions, primarily as defense compounds against herbivores and pathogens. Upon ingestion after consumption of cruciferous vegetables by human, glucosinolates break down to isothiocyanates and indoles, which have health benefits such as decreasing inflammation and lowering the risk of cancer.There are two types of myrosinases: typical (classical) and atypical myrosinases. Classical myrosinase proteins fold into an (beta/alpha)8 barrel structure and involve a glutamate (E) residue in the active site to initiate the release of an aglycone (thiohydroximate-O-sulfonate) by nucleophilic attack and form a glucosyl-enzyme intermediate. Another glutamine (Q) residue is also required for the subsequent hydrolysis of the glucosyl-enzyme intermediate with assistance from ascorbate, which acts as a cofactor and proton donor to promote the release of bound glucose. Classical myrosinases only use glucosinolates as the substrates. On the other hand, atypical myrosinases have two catalytic glutamate residues (EE) as acid/base catalyst in the active site but do not require ascorbate as a cofactor. Atypical myrosinases also contain additional basic amino acid residues at specific positions for glucosinolate binding. Unlike classical myrosinases, atypical myrosinases can both indole glucosinolates and O-glucosides as substrates.Both classical and atypical myrosinases belong to glycoside hydrolase family 1, which, in Arabidopsis, is composed of 47 BETA-GLUCOSIDASE (BGLU) genes and a BGLU-like gene, AFR2. There are six BGLU genes (BGLU34-BGLU39) encoding classical myrosinases (TGG1-TGG6). TGG1 and TGG2 are primarily expressed in leaves and flowers, while TGG4 and TGG5 are specifically expressed in roots. TGG3 and TGG6 are non-functional pseudogenes. Atypical myrosinases include PEN2/BGLU26 and PYK10/BGLU23, which have been extensively analyzed in defense against pathogens and herbivores. Both the two EE catalytic residues at the active site and additional basic residues in the substrate-binding pocket identified in PEN2/BGLU26 and PYK10/BGLU23 are conserved among 16 Arabidopsis BGLU genes (BGLU18-33), indicating that other members of this BGLU subfamily may also have myrosinase activities. In Arabidopsis mature leaves, the classical TGG1 and TGG2 myrosinases and glucosinolates accumulate in two different types of cells. This dual-cell type of chemical defense is activated upon tissue damage, which allows myrosinases gain access to glucosinolates to produce the toxic compounds. In Arabidopsis seedlings, on the other hand, high levels of atypical myrosinases PYK10/BGLU23 and related beta-glucosidase accumulate in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived organelles called ER bodies and can obtain access to the glucosinolates stored in the vacuole in the same cell upon tissue damage, enabling a single-cell chemical defense system.3. The Dual-Cell Type of Mustard Oil BombsIn the dual-cell type of mustard oil bombs, glucosinolates and myrosinases are localized in different cells to maintain their stability (Figure 2). Glucosinolates are present in organs throughout the plant from roots to flowers. However, glucosinolates are particularly high in a special type of cells called S-cells based on their high sulfur content. In Arabidopsis, S-cells exist as groups between the endoderms and the phloem cells of each vascular bundle. On the other hand, classical myrosinases localized to protein-accumulating idioblasts called myrosin cells (Figure 2). In Arabidopsis, TGG1 and TGG2 are expressed specifically in myrosin cells along leaf veins and stomatal guard cells. TGG1 and TGG2 proteins are abundant in aerial organs of Arabidopsis plants but their levels in myrosin cells are usually much higher than in guard cells. Both glucosinolates and myrosinases are stored in the vacuole of their respective S- and myrosin cells.Other studies in different plant species have, however, presented a more complex or even contradictory picture about the cellular compartmentation of the dual-cell mustard oil bomb. In Brassica juncea seedlings, it was found that myrosinases co-localize with glucosinolates in aleurone-type cells. Even in Arabidopsis, both myrosinases and GLSs are present in suspension cells. Additionally, guard cells contain not only myrosinases but also glucosinolates, as confirmed by metabolomics data. GLS metabolism is altered in guard cells upon treatment with CO2, and ABA and plays a role in stomatal movement based on the analysis of the effect of ABA on stomatal movement of the Arabidopsis myrosinase mutant tgg1 and other genetic mutants. Furthermore, stomatal closure was induced by pharmacological treatments with different glucosinolate hydrolysis products. Given the expression of TGG genes in guard cells, it is very likely that the classical myrosinases are involved in the glucosinolate metabolism in guard cells. Therefore, classical myrosinases can also be present in the same cells as glucosinolates, and there are additional mechanisms such as spatial separation at the subcellular levels and tight control of myrosinase activities that play a role in the stability of the mustard oil bombs.4. The Single-Cell Type of Mustard Oil BombThe single-cell type of mustard oil bomb involved ER-derived organelles (ER bodies) that accumulate atypical myrosinases and the vacuole that stores glucosinolates in the same cell (Figure 2). Like glucosinolates, ER bodies are present in the Brassicales order, including Arabidopsis. ER bodies have a rod shape, about 1 mum in diameter and 10 mum in length, and were originally reported from transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing ER-targeted GFP. Under electron microscopy, ER bodies have a single membrane covered by ribosomes and are continuous to the ER network. Based on tissue specificity, ER bodies have been classified into two types: (i) constitutive ER bodies present in the epidermal cells of the cotyledons, hypocotyls, and roots and (ii) wound/jasmonic acid (JA)-inducible ER bodies in the rosette leaves of Arabidopsis. More recently, it has been reported that there is a third type of ER bodies known as leaf ER bodies that is constitutively present in specific cells of rosette leaves (marginal cells, epidermal cells covering the midrib, and giant pavement cells). PYK10/BGLU23, an atypical myrosinase with a KDEL ER retention signal at its C terminus, is the major protein component of the constitutive ER bodies in Arabidopsis. Constitutive ER bodies in Arabidopsis also accumulate at the membrane two integral membrane proteins with a metal ion transporter activity, MEMBRANE OF ER BODY1 (MEB1) and MEB2. Wound-inducible ER bodies, on the other hand, accumulate primarily BGLU18, another KDEL-tailed beta-glucosidase family, whereas leaf ER bodies accumulate both PYK10/BGLU23 and BGLU18.There are eight genes encoding KDEL-tailed BGLU proteins (BGLU18 to 25) in Arabidopsis. Biochemical analysis indicates that these BGLU proteins in the ER bodies have a myrosinase activity that hydrolyzes glucosinolates to generate chemically reactive products toxic to pathogens and herbivores. Apparently, in the seedlings, the atypical myrosinases and glucosinolates are stored in ER bodies and vacuole, respectively, in the same cells and gain access to each other upon tissue damage to produce toxic products, thereby constituting a mustard bomb that operates through a single-cell mechanism (Figure 2). Importantly, there is a striking co-expression pattern among genes associated with the ER body, glucosinolate biosynthesis, and metabolism, indicating strong coordination among these processes. The role of the single-cell type of mustard oil bomb in plant chemical defense is supported by the finding that Arabidopsis mutants deficient in the ER body formation are hypersusceptible to herbivores such as woodlice and the chewing insect Spodoptera exigua. In the ER body-deficient Arabidopsis mutants, there is also overgrowth of the beneficial fungus Piriformospora indica without beneficial effects on the plants. Thus, ER body formation is important in plant defense that enables an appropriate level of fungal colonization to establish a mutualistic interaction between the symbiotic partners. The ER body may also play a role in plant responses to abiotic stresses, including drought and metal ion toxicity.Genetic analysis in Arabidopsis has identified two genes, NAI1 and NAI2, with a critical role in the ER body formation in Arabidopsis. NAI1 encodes a bHLH-type transcription factor and functions as a master regulator of the ER body formation by regulating the expression of genes associated with ER bodies including PYK10/BGLU23, NAI2, MEB1, and MEB2. NAI2 encodes an ER body component that is required for the constitutive ER body formation in Arabidopsis. In the nai2 mutants, PYK10/BGLU23, MEB1, and MEB2 proteins are diffused throughout the ER and the levels of PYK10 are reduced, indicating that the formation of the ER bodies promotes accumulation of PYK10. NAI2 forms complexes with MEB1 and MEB2 and, therefore, may function as receptors or adaptor for the recruitment and organization of these ER body cargo proteins. In Arabidopsis, NAI2 has a close homolog, TONSOKU (TSK)-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN1 (TSA1), which is required for wound/JA-induced ER body formation. Like ER bodies and glucosinolates, homologs of NAI2 and TSA1 are found only in plants in the Brassicaceae order, suggesting that NAI2 and its homologs have evolved specifically for the formation of the ER bodies.5. Development and Evolutionary Origin of Myrosin CellsMyrosin cells are found along veins in Arabidopsis and other Brassicales plants. Based on the close proximity of myrosin cells to vascular precursor cells and phloem cells, myrosin cells could belong to a vascular cell lineage and differentiate from vascular and vascular precursor cells. More recent studies, however, have provided evidence against this hypothesis. Instead, these studies have shown that myrosin cells are differentiated directly from ground meristem cells (Figure 3). Ground meristem cells, located in the inner tissues of leaf primordia, are also the mother cells for vascular precursor cells and mesophyll cells (Figure 3). Ground meristem cells can first differentiate into isodiametric small myrosin precursor cells, which mature into the large and irregular idioblast myrosin cells. Therefore, myrosin cells are developmentally independent of the vasculature in Arabidopsis leaves.A number of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors including FAMA, SCREAM (SCRM), and SCRM2 function as master regulators of myrosin cell differentiation (Figure 3). FAMA expression starts in isodiametric small cells, and its mutation abolishes myrosin cell differentiation and accumulation of TGG1 and TGG2. Overexpression of FAMA, on the other hand, leads to production of a large number of myrosin cells. SCRM and SCRM2 interact with FAMA and play a redundantly essential role in myrosin cell development. Importantly, these three transcription factors are also master regulators of guard cell differentiation (Figure 3). Thus, myrosin cell development is regulated by transcriptional network similar to that in guard cell development. FAMA-SCRM/2 heterodimers, as common master regulators of the development of both myrosin cells and guard cells, also provide strong evidence that these two types of cells are evolutionarily related. Guard cells are present in all plants including moss and hornwort. In contrast, TGG-accumulating myrosin cells appeared much later only in Brassicales plants. It has been proposed that an ancestral Brassicales plant first accumulated glucosinolates after TGG1 or a similar myrosinase became connected with FAMA-mediated transcriptional cascade in guard cells. The ancestral Brassicales plants accumulated glucosinolates in stomatal guard cells and produced isothiocyanates, which could be transported to the extracellular region by proteins such as PEN3 for defense against invading pathogens. The ancestral Brassicales plants subsequently acquired myrosin cells along leaf veins when FAMA expression began in ground meristem cells of inner leaf tissues during evolution.6. Evolutionary Origin of ER BodiesAs sessile organisms, plant cells highly regulate their endomembrane system including the ER. In addition, plants produce several types of functionally specialized ER-derived vesicles. Unlike COPII vesicles in the classical secretory pathway, these specialized ER-derived vesicles carry specific proteins but do not travel through the well-characterized ER-to-Golgi transport pathway. Some of these ER-derived vesicles such as protein bodies accumulate storage proteins and can exist as independent storage organelles or traffic specific storage proteins directly from the ER to the storage vacuole in a Golgi-independent manner. Other specialized ER-derived vesicles such as ER bodies accumulate proteases and hydrolytic enzymes with roles in plant growth, development and stress responses. While all plants can form protein bodies, ER bodies are formed only in Brassicaceae plants. An important evolutionary question about ER bodies is where they arose. Did they originate de novo in Brassicaceae plants or evolve from preexisting ER structures? We have recently provided important insights into the evolutionary origin of the ER bodies based on the analysis of three closely related NAI2-interacting proteins (NAIP1, 2, and 3) from Arabidopsis. The three NAIP all contain a C-terminal region homologous to the protein-binding harmonin homology domain (HHD) that interacts with NAI2. The three proteins also contain a similar N-terminal coiled-coil (CC) domain. The middle regions of NAIPs are highly divergent but all contain multiple threonine/serine-proline phosphorylation sites by proline-directed protein kinases such as mitogen-activated protein kinases and cyclin-dependent protein kinases. Thus, the NAIP proteins contain multiple protein-interacting motifs and are potentially subjected to regulation by protein phosphorylation. There is no homolog of NAIPs in the archaea, eubacteria, fungi, or animals. NAIP homologs are found in the phylum of Apicomplexa in the large clade of parasitic alveolate in protista. Importantly, there are NAIP homologs in all plants including the unicellular green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the moss Physcomitrella patens, the fern Selaginella moellendorffii, and in both angiosperms and gymnosperms. Thus, NAIP proteins have originated in early eukaryotes and are present in all land plants, typically as a small family of three to four members.Genetic analysis showed that constitutive ER body formation is almost completely abolished in the naip1/naip2/naip3 triple mutant, as in the nai2 mutant, but is normal in the naip single and naip1/naip2 double mutants. Thus, NAIPs play a critical and redundant role in the ER body formation. Studies using NAIP-GFP fusions further revealed that NAIP1 formed punctate structures in a tissue-specific pattern identical to those of known ER body markers and in an NAI2-dependent manner, indicating that NAIP1 is specifically associated with the ER bodies. On the other hand, NAIP2- and NAIP3-GFP are associated not only with the ER bodies but also with other unknown vesicular structures whose formation is ubiquitous and NAI2 independent. Based on these findings, we have proposed that the NAI2/TSA1-containing ER bodies in the Brassicales may have evolved from a family of preexisting NAIP-containing ER-derived structures widely present not only in plants (Figure 4). In Arabidopsis, NAIP1 has evolved to be functionally highly specialized for ER body formation, whereas NAIP2 and NAIP3 are less specialized and function as components of not only the ER bodies but also other ER-derived structures that can be formed in a wider range of plant tissues (Figure 4). It remains to be determined about the biochemical and functional nature of the other NAIP-containing vesicles, which the ER bodies are related to and likely evolved from. What cargo proteins do they carry? Do they also have roles in plant defense?7. Countering and Exploiting the Mustard Oil Bomb by Pests and PathogensThe glucosinolate-myrosinase system protects Brassicales plants against herbivores and pathogens with toxic hydrolytic products of glucosinolates. On the other hand, many herbivores and pathogens have also evolved different mechanisms that counter the mustard oil bomb. These mechanisms include modification of glucosinolates to prevent formation of toxic hydrolytic products and metabolic diversion that prevent formation of highly toxic to less toxic metabolites. The diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella), a crucifer specialist insect, produces glucosinolate sulfatase as a gut content that catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucosinolates to produce desulfo-glucosinolates, which are not myrosinase substrates (Figure 5). Importantly, the glucosinolate sulfatase acts on all major classes of glucosinolates, thus effectively disarming the mustard oil bomb and enabling diamondback moths to use a broad range of cruciferous host plants. Another specialist insect herbivore, Pieris rapae, one of the most abundant butterflies and pests in Northern and Central Europe and in North America, uses a different counter-adaptation mechanism that enables them to feed on Brassicales plants without severe negative effects (Figure 5). There is a larval gut protein from P. rapae that redirects the glucosinolate hydrolysis toward nitrile formation instead of isothiocyanates. This protein, designated the nitrile-specifier protein, has no hydrolytic activity on glucosinolates by itself and is unrelated to any functionally characterized protein. Isothiocyanates are highly reactive compounds toxic to a broad range of organisms (including P. rapae, whereas nitriles are generally less toxic than isothiocyanates, and larvae of P. rapae excrete nitriles in the feces with or without further metabolism). How the nitrile-specifier protein alters the metabolic products of glucosinolates is still unknown. The protein itself does not have hydrolytic activity on glucosinolates but may serve as a cofactor of plant myrosinase to alters the direction of glucosinolate hydrolysis.Other herbivores develop other mechanisms such as sequestering glucosinolates and inhibition of plant myrosinases to counter the mustard oil bomb. The specialist flea beetle, Phyllotreta armoraciae, is capable of absorbing from the gut high levels of glucosinolates in the body and can thus at least partially avoid plant myrosinase activity (Figure 5). Interestingly, feeding experiments with the myrosinase-deficient Arabidopsis tgg1/tgg2 mutant and wild type plants indicate that plant myrosinases reduced the glucosinolate sequestration rate by the insect in adult beetles. Further analysis revealed that P. armoraciae can inactivate plant myrosinases in the gut to both reduce glucosinolate hydrolysis and promote their sequestering. These findings indicate that adaptations of P. armoraciae to their brassicaceous host plants involve both the ability to tolerate plant myrosinase activity and a fast glucosinolate uptake mechanism.Microbial pathogens also have mechanisms to counter the mustard oil bomb. Sulforaphane (4-methylsulfinylbutyl isothiocyanate), a natural product derived from aliphatic glucosinolates, inhibits growth of non-host Pseudomonas bacteria in Arabidopsis plants. The survival in Arabidopsis extracts genes (saxCAB/F/D/G) identified in Pseudomonas species virulent on Arabidopsis are required to overwhelm isothiocyanate-based defenses and facilitate a disease outcome, especially in the young leaves critical for plant survival (Figure 5). As a result, a virulent P. syringar DC3000 pathogen lacking SaxA/B/F/D/G genes could not grow in young Arabidopsis leaves but could grow in young leaves of Arabidopsis myb28 myb29 mutants, which did not produce aliphatic glucosinolates. The accumulated amounts of the major glucosinolates were unchanged in plants overexpressing SaxA, suggesting that SaxA inhibits aliphatic isothiocyanate production after glucosinolate breakdown. These combined results indicate that aliphatic isothiocyanates are effective not only in limiting damage by herbivores but also in defense against microbial bacterial pathogens, and, therefore, there is also an arms race between Brassicales plants and their pathogens.Some adapted herbivore specialists have also evolved mechanisms that exploit glucosinolates produced by host plants for defense against their predators or for interspecific communication. In two aphid species, Brevicoryne brassicae and Lipaphis erysimi, these specialist insects sequester glucosinolates and convert these glucosinolates to toxic products by using their own myrosinase, encoded in the aphid genome (Figure 5). It has been shown that the higher level of glucosinolates in B. brassicae had a significant negative impact on survival of Adalia bipunctata, a ladybird predator. Likewise, flea beetles of the genus Phyllotreta possess the glucosinolate-myrosinase defense system that consists of sequestered glucosinolates from plant hosts an insect myrosinases capable of converting the non-toxic glucosinolates to deterrent isothiocyanates (Figure 5). A comparison of two different stages of the horseradish flea beetle P. armoraciae showed that the larvae contained 1.5-fold less glucosinolates but 43.4-fold higher myrosinase activity than the pupae. Importantly, while larvae produced high amounts of toxic isothiocyanates when they were attacked by the generalist predator Harmonia axyridis and deterred the predator and survived on attack, the pupae did not produce high levels of the toxic products of glucosinolates and were killed. The glucosinolate-myrosinase system has also been exploited by microbial pathogens to counter plant defense. For example, ER bodies are induced by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae in a manner dependent on the bacterial toxin coronatine but play a negative role in immunity against the bacterial pathogen. Thus, the bacterial pathogen exploits the ER bodies as a counter-defense mechanism to promote virulence."}, "36179100": {"doi": "10.1093/plphys/kiac463"}, "26334264": {"doi": "10.3390/molecules200915827", "title": "Comparison of Glucosinolate Profiles in Different Tissues of Nine Brassica Crops", "abstract": "Glucosinolate (GSL) profiles and concentrations in various tissues (seeds, sprouts, mature root, and shoot) were determined and compared across nine Brassica species, including cauliflower, cabbage, broccoli, radish, baemuchae, pakchoi, Chinese cabbage, leaf mustard, and kale.

Seeds had highest total GSL concentrations in most of crops, whereas shoots had the lowest GSL concentrations.

The lowest GSL concentrations were observed in radish across all tissues examined.", "intro": "1. IntroductionMany epidemiological studies have suggested that diets rich in fruits and vegetables are positively associated with human health in many ways, including reduced risk of cancers, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. Brassicaceae vegetables, as a group, possess a large number of health-promoting compounds such as vitamins, carotenoids, flavonoids, polyphenols, minerals, and glucosinolates (GSLs) in considerable amounts. Among these health-promoting phytochemicals, GSLs (beta-thioglucoside-N-hydroxysulfates) are an important chemical group naturally occurring in almost all Brassica species. GSLs are a group of sulfur-containing glucosides that are hydrolyzed by the endogenous enzyme myrosinase into isothiocynates (ITCs), thiocynates, and nitriles. More than 200 GSLs have been identified in Brassica crops, and they are characterized mainly by the variable R group, which can be aromatic, indolic, or aliphatic derivatives of the amino acid precursors methionine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine, respectively. GSLs and their products have different biological functions, including anticancer, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, anti-oxidative, and allelopathic properties. For example, ITCs such as sulforaphane, iberin, phenylethyl, and prop-2-enyl, derived from glucoraphanin, glucoiberin, gluconasturtiin, and sinigrin, respectively, have been found to induce phase 2 enzymes promoting anti-proliferative activity. GSLs can also be used as an alternative to synthetic pesticides for pest and disease control. Some GSLs such as sinigrin and progoitrin are also responsible for the bitter flavor of these crucifers and influence consumer acceptance; therefore, the determination of GSL concentrations in Brassica vegetables is important in the study of such activities in Brassica vegetables.The content and profile of GSLs in Brassica vegetables significantly varies depending on various plant-specific factors such as the cultivar genotype, growth stage, or structure where GSL accumulates, as well as environmental conditions of temperature, light, water and nutrient availability, growing season, agricultural practices, and post-harvest conditions. For example, variance in GSL concentrations was observed in the same broccoli genotype grown in different seasons and under different agricultural practices. Thus far, most research work has focused on seed and fully mature plants. Studies of GSL concentrations in sprouts are limited to a few members of Brassicaceae. Moreover, a paucity of research addresses GSL patterns and concentrations in the young shoots and roots of different Brassica species, in addition to the seeds and sprouts. Brassica crops such as cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, radish, baemuchae, kale, pakchoi, Chinese cabbage, and leaf mustard are commonly used for various side dishes in many countries. Thus, investigation of GSL profiles and concentrations in crop commodities will be useful for consumers and agribusiness, in general. In addition, GSL profiling in roots, combined with seeds and other plant tissues, will improve our understanding of the distribution pattern of GSLs in whole plant tissues. Thus, in this study, we investigated GSL profiles of seeds, sprouts, roots, and shoots across nine widely consumed Brassica vegetables for the comparative analysis of GSL profiles.", "results": "2. Results and Discussion2.1. Variation in GSL Concentration in SeedsThis study focused on examining the GSL profiles and their concentrations in various tissues and growth stages of nine Brassica crops. A total of 12 GSLs belonging to the three chemical classes were analyzed; these included nine aliphatic, one indolyl, and two aromatic GSLs. Identification and quantification of GSL peaks by chromatography were based upon the known concentrations of commercial standards and their retention time. A typical GSL chromatogram of standard mixture (A) and sample extract (B) is shown in Figure 1. Detailed information of individual desulfo-GSLs and their concentrations in the seeds of all nine Brassica crops examined were recorded (Table 1 and Table 2). These data show that the concentrations varied depending on the plant type and structure. The most commonly observed GSL was BRA, although it was present in lower quantities than the other GSLs.The dominant GSL varied according to the crop type and plant tissues examined. SIN was most abundant GSL in cauliflower (35.43 micromol g-1), kale (66.49 micromol g-1), and leaf mustard (80.44 micromol g-1), whereas NAP was present in high concentrations in pakchoi (103.51 micromol g-1), baemuchae (18.10 micromol g-1), and Chinese cabbage (17.13 micromol g-1). Similarly, broccoli, cabbage, and radish exhibited higher ERU (76.35 micromol g-1), PRO (53.53 micromol g-1), and GRA contents (0.90 micromol g-1) than the other GSLs. GRE was only found in radish and baemuchae. These crop-dependent dominant GSLs were in good agreement with the results of previous studies. Total GSL concentrations varied significantly among the crop types, with broccoli, cabbage, and pakchoi showing relatively higher total GSLs (<100 micromol g-1) than the other crops. Radish seeds showed exceptionally lower total GSL content (2.45 micromol g-1) across all crop types examined.2.2. Variation in GSL Concentration in SproutsThe GSL profiles and concentrations in nine-day-old Brassica sprouts were also compared. NAP, BRA, and NAS were the most common GSL present in all crops examined (Table 3). SIN was a major GSL in cauliflower (33.90 micromol g-1), kale (55.56 micromol g-1), and pakchoi (20.22 micromol g-1), whereas ERU was a major GSL in broccoli (123.67 micromol g-1), cabbage (34.88 micromol g-1), and radish (1.25 micromol g-1) sprouts, as found in seeds. ERU has both direct and indirect antioxidant effects; therefore, the presence of ERU at a higher ratio in broccoli, cabbage, and radish suggested that these crops had more health benefits than the other crops examined.Similar to seeds, GRE was only present in radish and baemuchae; however, the values in nine-day-old sprouts were relatively lower than those in seeds. Total GSL concentration also significantly varied from 2.46 micromol g-1 in radish to 162.19 micromol g-1 in broccoli. Only six of the 12 GSLs identified in this study were observed in radish; these include GRA, GRE, NAP, ERU, BRA, and NAS. Moreover, these GSLs, except GRE, were detected in very minute quantities as compared to those in other crops. In contrast, the highest number of GSLs (10 GSLs) was found in cabbage. Total GSL concentration was relatively lower in 9 day-old sprouts than in seeds of cabbage, Chinese cabbage, baemuchae, kale, pakchoi, and leaf mustard, whereas it was exceptionally higher in broccoli (162.19 micromol g-1). Furthermore, cauliflower and radish exhibited very similar GSL contents in both seeds and nine-day-old sprouts.2.3. Variation in GSL Concentration in ShootsThe GSL profile and concentrations in the shoots of Brassica crops also showed different accumulation patterns (Table 4) and the genotypic variation was statistically significant; this may be attributed to the difference in the regulatory mechanism of genes involved in GSL biosynthesis. PRO, BRA, and NAS were the most common GSLs found in all the crops examined. Among these, BRA was the most dominant GSL in cauliflower (2.56 micromol g-1), broccoli (1.44 micromol g-1), cabbage (3.13 micromol g-1), and Chinese cabbage (1.10 micromol g-1), whereas NAP and SIN were the dominant GSLs in pakchoi (8.24 micromol g-1) and leaf mustard (52.00 micromol g-1), respectively. The highest concentrations of SIN observed in seeds and shoots was in good agreement with the results reported by Gupta et al., who analyzed 97 lines of leaf mustard. The concentrations of PRO, which was found in relatively higher quantities in the seeds of most crops examined, were considerably reduced in shoots, except for in radish and leaf mustard. Similarly, ERU, a major GSL in broccoli and cabbage seeds was not present in broccoli shoot and its concentration was considerably reduced in cabbage shoots, which might be due to the catabolic processes in play during the development of plant tissue. In addition to the seeds and sprouts, shoots of radish and baemuchae possessed GRE, and, in fact, at relatively higher concentrations. Total GSL content in most crops were considerably reduced in shoots compared to that on seeds and sprouts except for in leaf mustard, which possessed relatively higher total GSL content than that in sprouts. However, the value observed in this study was within the range of fully matured floret/leaf parts described in previous reports. 2.4. Variation in GSL Concentration in RootsIn Brassica roots, the most abundant GSLs were ERU, BRA, and NAS, of which NAS was present in the highest quantity in almost all crops, ranging from 0.12 micromol g-1 in radish to 57.76 micromol g-1 in leaf mustard (Table 5). ERU was the second major GSL in broccoli, cabbage, radish, baemuchae, kale, and pakchoi and the concentration was higher than in shoots that suggests higher health beneficial value of root as ERU has several antioxidant effects. In contrast, other GSLs showed different accumulation patterns depending on the crop type. Total GSL concentration ranged from 4.51 micromol g-1 in radish to 73.61 micromol g-1 in leaf mustard. Moreover, total GSL concentration was higher in roots than in shoots, which is mainly due to the relatively higher concentration of NAS in roots than in other tissues. This finding also indicates a higher nutritive value of Brassica roots as breakdown products of NAS are known to have potential beneficial effects on human health. Likewise, total GSLs concentration in roots in all the crops in this study were relatively higher than in their fully matured edible parts, as described in previous reports.2.5. Overall Variation in GSL ConcentrationAmong the different tissues or growth stages, in most Brassica vegetables examined, the highest GSL concentrations were noted in seeds, which then gradually decreased in sprouts and other parts. However, individual GSL concentrations were not consistent across all tissues examined. These observations, in general, are in good agreement with previous reports of broccoli and Chinese cabbage, and this might be due to the result of dilution caused by tissue expansion as a consequence of the metabolism of GSLs. Furthermore, almost all the crops exhibited higher concentrations of GSLs in sprouts than in shoots. Similar results were also observed in sulforaphane and sulforaphene (hydrolyzed products from GRA and GRE, respectively) contents in broccoli and baemuchae, respectively, which might be attributed to the dilution of individual GSLs across the stages of development. Likewise, similar to the previous report by Li et al., relatively higher GSLs levels could also observed in sprouts than in leaves in radish. However, an opposite trend was noted in leaf mustard, which showed higher GSL concentration in its shoots than in sprouts; this might be due to the difference in the regulatory mechanism underlying the GSL biosynthetic pathway. Total aliphatic GSL concentration decreased in shoots than in seeds and sprouts for all crops examined, except leaf mustard. In contrast, BRA (an indole GSL) in shoots was higher than that in seeds and sprouts that could be due to de novo synthesis of this GSL during plant growth.Higher GSL concentrations were observed in roots than in shoots at the same developmental stages across all crops, which are in accordance with previous reports of radish and cabbage. In addition, GSL distribution patterns and concentrations in roots and shoots differed, because both these tissues have different regulatory mechanisms of GSL biosynthesis and turnover. The differences in GSL contents across shoots and roots were essentially due to the difference in the contents of some specific GSLs such as ERU and NAS. In accordance with Bellostas et al. and Velasco et al., all the crops examined possessed relatively higher concentrations of aliphatic GSLs in their seeds, sprouts, and shoots, and their composition varied depending on the crop type and the tissues. Allelic variation in the genes encoding key regulatory enzymes at key points in the GSL pathway could also result in these differences. Aliphatic GSLs constituted more than 85% of total GSLs in the seeds and sprouts of most crops, whereas they constituted 37%-98% of total GSLs in shoots.However, among the aromatic GSLs, NAS was more dominant in the root than in other plant parts, except in radish. Similarly, higher NAS concentrations were also previously recorded in cabbage and pakchoi roots, and the root GSLs exhibited higher variation than shoot GSLs. The higher total GSL concentrations and greater variation in their content in roots might be attributed to the higher survival pressure of roots because the roots endure numerous pathogens that are abundant in the soil environment. The different GSLs found in higher amount in the root may act as defensive compounds to deter invasion by these soil organisms. PRO, one of the major GSLs in seeds and sprouts in most of the crops (except in pakchoi, leaf mustard, and radish) was present in relatively low concentrations in other parts examined. NAP, which was present in most of the crops and their respective tissues/developmental stages, was also present at the highest concentrations in seeds. However, radish and leaf mustard showed some unusual GSL content distribution. Furthermore, ERU was exceptionally lower or not found in shoots compared to other tissues in almost all crops examined. BRA showed opposite trend of accumulation with the highest content in shoot, which was gradually decreased in roots, nine-day-old sprouts, and was the lowest in seeds in most crops. Similarly, higher BRA content was also previously reported in mature tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana, likely due to the de novo synthesis of BRA with growth of these crops. The NAS content was high in roots than in seeds, sprouts, and shoots in most crops examined, which resulted in higher levels of total GSL in roots. Such a remarkable variation in GSLs content and profiles within different tissues of a crop and among the different crops reflect variations in the control mechanisms underlying GSL biosynthetic pathways in different tissues of a single plant or might result from alternation in substrate availability or selective catabolism of certain GSLs, which has previously been observed in other species belonging to the order Capparales. To our knowledge, this is the first report of tissue distribution of several Brassica crops with accurate and speedy quantification (with in 18 min) using authentic 12 GSLs standards in UPLC while most of the other previous reports were based on the response factor or LC-MS based method.2.6. Correlationships among GSLsTo understand the distribution patterns of the various GSLs and the composition content of total GSLs identified in Brassica crops, we evaluated the correlationships among different GSLs regardless of plant genotypes and the tissue examined (Table 6). All GSLs exhibited either significantly positive or no correlationship in that only aliphatic GSLs showed significant positive correlations, which is due to the biosynthetic relationships among aliphatic GSLs. PRO, EPI, GRA, and ERU showed significantly positive correlationships with each other as well as with total GSLs. PRO, which was present in most of the crops and their parts in considerable amounts, exhibited the highest positive correlationship (p <= 0.001) with EPI (r = 0.944 ***), which was followed by GRA (r = 0.709 ***) and ERU (r = 0.649 ***). Furthermore, these GSLs also showed strongly positive correlationship with each other because all of these GSLs are 4 carbon aliphatic GSLs and follow quite similar biosynthetic pathway. NAP and BCN also showed positive correlationship (r = 0.356 *, p <= 0.05) with each other. ERU exhibited highest positive correlation with total GSLs (r = 0.701 ***), which was followed by PRO, EPI and GRA. In contrast, other aliphatic GSLs such as IBE, SIN, and GRE showed no relationships with total GSLs. Similarly, none of the aliphatic GSLs showed significant correlations with indole GSL (BRA) and aromatic GSL (NAS) as they are derived from different amino acid precursors. Furthermore, BRA and NAS showed no correlation with total GSLs, which might be because these GSLs were present in very minute quantities. However, a strong positive correlationship could be observed between NAS and total GSLs content in root parts (data not shown) that was due to the exceptionally higher content of NAS in roots."}, "26205053": {"doi": "10.3390/molecules200713089", "title": "Identification and Expression Analysis of Glucosinolate Biosynthetic Genes and Estimation of Glucosinolate Contents in Edible Organs of Brassica oleracea Subspecies", "abstract": "Glucosinolates are anti-carcinogenic, anti-oxidative biochemical compounds that defend plants from insect and microbial attack. Glucosinolates are abundant in all cruciferous crops, including all vegetable and oilseed Brassica species. Here, we studied the expression of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes and determined glucosinolate contents in the edible organs of a total of 12 genotypes of Brassica oleracea: three genotypes each from cabbage, kale, kohlrabi and cauliflower subspecies. Among the 81 genes analyzed by RT-PCR, 19 are transcription factor-related, two different sets of 25 genes are involved in aliphatic and indolic biosynthesis pathways and the rest are breakdown-related. The expression of glucosinolate-related genes in the stems of kohlrabi was remarkably different compared to leaves of cabbage and kale and florets of cauliflower as only eight genes out of 81 were expressed in the stem tissues of kohlrabi. In the stem tissue of kohlrabi, only one aliphatic transcription factor-related gene, Bol036286 (MYB28) and one indolic transcription factor-related gene, Bol030761 (MYB51), were expressed. The results indicated the expression of all genes is not essential for glucosinolate biosynthesis. Using HPLC analysis, a total of 16 different types of glucosinolates were identified in four subspecies, nine of them were aliphatic, four of them were indolic and one was aromatic. Cauliflower florets measured the highest number of 14 glucosinolates. Among the aliphatic glucosinolates, only gluconapin was found in the florets of cauliflower. Glucoiberverin and glucobrassicanapin contents were the highest in the stems of kohlrabi. The indolic methoxyglucobrassicin and aromatic gluconasturtiin accounted for the highest content in the florets of cauliflower. A further detailed investigation and analyses is required to discern the precise roles of each of the genes for aliphatic and indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis in the edible organs.", "intro": "1. IntroductionGlucosinolates, beta-thioglucoside-N-hydroxysulfates (cis-N-hydroximinosulfate esters), are sulfur-enriched, anionic secondary metabolites of plants synthesized from amino acids and sugars. They are synthesized in all vegetables and oilseed plants of the order Brassicales. Upon hydrolysis, these metabolites not only confer characteristic flavors to Brassica vegetables but also serve to prevent carcinogenesis in animals by regulating the cell cycle and stimulating apoptosis. Hydrolysis by the myrosinase enzyme degrades glucosinolates into different bioactive products, mostly isothiocyanates. Isothiocyanates such as sulforaphane and indole-3-carbinol are strongly anti-carcinogenic, whereas phenethyl isothiocyanate inhibits the transformation of carcinogens from one form to another. In addition to their anti-carcinogenic properties in the animals that consume them, glucosinolates are anti-oxidative and help defend against herbivores and microbes. Apart from the various benefits of glucosinolates, a few of them, for example progoitrin, are also reported to have adverse effects in animals, with goitrogenic effects (i.e., enlargement of the thyroid), although no evidence of any such effect has been reported in humans from Brassica consumption. It is important to understand the genetics of biosynthesis and accumulation of health-promoting glucosinolates in order to increase their content for human and animal health and plant protection.Plants contain over 200 structurally different glucosinolates, which are generally classified as aliphatic, indolic or aromatic based on their primary precursor amino acids. The basic precursors of aliphatic, indolic and aromatic glucosinolates are methionine (or alanine, leucine, isoleucine and valine), tryptophan and phenylalanine (or tyrosine), respectively. All three types of glucosinolates are generated by a characteristic biosynthetic pathway that involves elongation of the amino acid side chain by the addition of methylene groups, formation of core structure and subsequent secondary modification of amino acid side chains by oxidation, hydroxylation, methoxylation, sulfation, and glycosylation, etc.. In Brassica species, most of the glucosinolates are biosynthesized from methionine. Elongation of the methionine side chain involves methylthioalkylmalate synthase (MAM), bile acid:sodium symporter family protein 5 (BASS5) and branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT). Formation of the core structure is a five-step process that includes formation of aldoxime by cytochromes P450 of the CYP79 and CYP83 families, oxidation of aldoxime by members of the CYP83 family, formation of thiohydroximic acid followed by C-S cleavage, and formation of desulfoglucosinolate by S-glucosyltransferase and glucosinolates by sulfotransferase. Subsequent secondary modification involves several gene loci, for example those encoding GS-OX, GS-AOP, GS-OH, BZO1 and CYP81F2. R2R3-Myb transcript factors and other nucleus-localized regulators participate in glucosinolate biosynthesis. Moreover, the sulfate assimilatory pathway, which provides glutathione and 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate co-substrates during glucosinolate biosynthesis on desulfo precursor, also involves several other genes.Brassica oleracea is an important diversified vegetable species in which it has become clear that glucosinolate biosynthetic and catabolism pathways are different compared to those in Arabidopsis and B. rapa. B. oleracea also shows greater glucosinolate profile diversity than B. rapa and B. napus. B. oleracea and B. rapa respectively have 105 and 101 glucosinolate metabolism-related genes, among which 22 genes are related to catabolism. The coding DNA sequences of 84 B. oleracea genes related to glucosinolate biosynthesis are available in two independent databases: Bolbase and EnesmblPlants, but expression analysis has been carried out for none of those genes to date. Therefore, a comparative validation of the coding sequences deposited in the two databases is necessary prior to functional analysis. The glucosinolate biosynthesis and catabolism among Arabidopsis, B. rapa and B. oleracea is likely related but also shows variation in the proportion of tandem genes, and the number and functions of genes for MAM and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase (AOP). Functions of MAM family members for condensation, side chain elongation and chain length production during glucosinolate biosynthesis differs in Arabidopsis compared to B. rapa and B. oleracea. MYB76 transcription factor is present in Arabidopsis but B. oleracea and B. rapa lack in that factor. In addition to 4C glucosinolate, biosynthesis of sinigrin, a 3C glucosinolate, in B. oleracea is assumed to be related to high expression of the Bol017070 gene, while its ortholog, Bra013007, remain silenced in B. rapa. By contrast, B. rapa biosynthesizes more of the 5C glucosinolate glucobrassicanapin due to higher expression of MAM3 compared to that in B. oleracea. B. oleracea has only one functional AOP gene (AOP2) whereas Arabidopsis and B. rapa have four and three functional AOP genes, respectively.Under different environmental conditions a complex network of transcription factors from the R2R3-MYB family regulate the glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways. MYB28 and MYB29 are related to biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates while MYB51, MYB122 and MYB34 are related to indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis (Figure 1). Transcription factors and/or their stimulators might vary depending on herbivory and sulfur metabolism. Glucosinolate biosynthesis and catabolism differ not only among species but also across developmental stages of tissues and organs during plant development. B. oleracea is a vegetable-producing species that includes cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, kale, brussels sprouts and kohlrabi. The edible organs are different in different subspecies; leaf is the edible organ for cabbage (B. oleracea capitata) and kale (B. oleracea acephala), whereas stem and floret are the edible organs of kohlrabi (B. oleracea italica) and cauliflower (B. oleracea botrytis), respectively. Currently, little is known about the expression of genes related to glucosinolate biosynthesis at in the edible organs of B. oleracea cultivars from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. In this study, we explored the genes related to glucosinolate biosynthesis and studied their expression in the edible organs of B. oleracea cultivars. We also measured glucosinolate contents in different edible organs of cabbage, kale, kohlrabi and cauliflower.", "results": "3. Results and Discussion3.1. Genes Related to Glucosinolate Biosynthesis and BreakdownA total of 84 B. oleracea genes orthologous to B. rapa genes related to glucosinolate biosynthesis, transcriptional regulation and breakdown were identified (Table 2).These 84 genes were distributed across all nine chromosomes of B. oleracea (Supplementary Table S1). Aliphatic biosynthesis, indolic biosynthesis and transcription factor-related genes identified in this study were not clustered in any particular chromosome, but rather were distributed across all nine chromosomes (Supplementary Table S1). The highest numbers of aliphatic and indolic biosynthesis genes were located on chromosomes C4 and C3, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). Nine genes were not able to be assigned to a chromosome and three AOP2 genes, related to aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis, were absent in Bolbase although they were present in EnsemblPlants (Table 2, Supplementary Table S1). Per Bolbase, the highest and the lowest number of glucosinolate genes per chromosome were 14 and four in chromosomes C3 and C2, respectively. There was more than 93% identity in coding sequence (CDS) for 77 genes between Bolbase and EnsemblPlants (Table 2). Three MAM1/2 genes and one SUR1 gene, showed 78%-89% identity in the two databases. CDS regions differed in number of nucleotides between the two databases for several genes (Table 2). The aliphatic and indolic glucosinolate pathways involved two sets of 32 genes and seven shared genes including three genes for GGP1, four genes for SUR1 (Bol038764 and Bol038765 have identical CDS) and one gene for UGT74B1 (Table 2, Figure 1). Twenty genes were transcription related and five genes were related to aglucone biosynthesis through the breakdown of glucosinolates (Figure 1). MYB28 and MYB29 are aliphatic transcription factor-related and MYB51, MYB122 and MYB34 are indolic transcription factor-related genes in B. oleracea (Figure 1). The pairs of genes Bol000201 and Bol019784 for TFL2, Bol033373 and Bol033374 for GS-OH, and Bol038764 and Bol038765 for SUR1 each shared the same CDS (Table 2).3.2. Glucosinolate-Related Gene Expression in B. oleracea SubspeciesCompared to the edible organs of the other three subspecies, the stem samples of kohlrabi had much lower expression of many glucosinolate-related genes (Figure 2, Supplementary Figure S1). However, at least one gene from each of the following categories was expressed in the stems of kohlrabi: transcription factor, core structure formation, secondary modification and aglucone biosynthesis (Figure 2). Expression of side chain elongation-related genes was low in all four subspecies (Figure 2). The majority of other genes were highly expressed only in the leaves of cabbage and kale and in the florets of cauliflower (Figure 2). Only eight genes out of 84 were expressed similarly in the stems of kohlrabi as in leaves of cabbage and kale and floret of cauliflower (Supplementary Figure S1). These genes were MYB28, MYB51, IQD1 and TFL2 of the transcription-factor related set, AOP2 and ST5b aliphatic genes; the CSTF9 indolic gene and the TGG2 aglucone biosynthesis-related gene (Supplementary Figure S1). Genotypic differences in gene expression within subspecies for particular genes were also remarkable (Supplementary Figure S1). Some genes yielded notably different product size compared to the expected, for example: SUR1 (Bol038764, Bol038765), TGG2 (Bol025706), TGG5 (Bol031599). The observed product size of Bol038764, Bol025706 and Bol031599 were approximately 850, 800 and 900 bp whereas the expected product sizes from the primers designed based on Bolbase data were 360, 421 and 402 respectively (Supplementary Figure S1). Eight aliphatic pathway genes, three indolic pathway genes, five transcription factor-related genes and one breakdown-related gene were expressed in almost all genotypes of four cultivars (Supplementary Figure S1). These included aliphatic pathway CYP83A1 (Bol005188), GSTF11 (Bol000843), ST5b (Bol026201, Bol026202), ST5c (Bol030757), FMOGS-OX5 (Bol031350) and GSL-OH (Bol033373, Bol033374); indolic pathway GSTF9 (Bol033376, Bol004624) and GSTF10 (Bol004625); transcription factor-related MYB28 (Bol036286), Dof1.1 (Bol041144), IQD1 (Bol023096) and TFL2 (Bol000201, Bol019784) and breakdown-related TGG2 (Bol025706). Notably, expression levels of ST5b (Bol026202) and GSTF9 (Bol004624) were quite similar across all 12 genotypes (Supplementary Figure S1). Ten genes were expressed only in cabbage, kale and cauliflower but not in the stem of kohlrabi (Supplementary Figure S1). These genes were CYP83A1 (Bol040365), ST5a (Bol026200), SUR1 (Bol038764, Bol038765, Bol029775), UGT74B1 (Bol005786), Dof1.1 (Bol023400, Bol006511), TFL2 (Bol021358), and PEN2 (Bol030092).3.3. Glucosinolate Analysis in B. oleracea SubspeciesHPLC analysis revealed the presence of 16 different types of glucosinolates in three different edible organs of four different subspecies of B. oleracea (Supplementary Table S2, Table 4). Cabbage leaves contained 12 glucosinolates, kale leaves contained 10, kohlrabi stems contained 11 and the cauliflower florets contained 14. Gluconapin, glucoalyssin, gluconapoleiferin and 4-hydroxy glucobrassicin were identified only the florets of cauliflower (Table 4). Glucoerucin was only found in the cabbage leaves, and glucoiberverin was identified in the cabbage leaves and kohlrabi stems (Table 4). The absolute amount of the three aliphatic glucosinolates gluconapin, glucoiberverin and glucobrassicanapin differed significantly or marginally among the edible organs (Table 4). Stems of kohlrabi contained the most glucoiberverin and glucobrassicanapin while the florets of cauliflower contained the highest gluconapin content compared to other edible organs (Table 4). Cauliflower florets recorded the highest content of methoxyglucobrassicin and gluconasturtiin, which are respectively indolic and aromatic glucosinolates (Table 4). Out of 11 aliphatic glucosinolates identified in three types of edible organs in 12 genotypes of four B. oleracea subspecies, only gluconapin, glucoalyssin and gluconapoleiferin were expressed in the florets of cauliflower (Table 4, Supplementary Table S3).3.4. DiscussionIn this study a total of 84 genes related to glucosinolate biosynthesis in B. oleracea were compared. Furthermore, the expression of those genes and biosynthesis of glucosinolates in the edible organs were monitored in four B. oleracea subspecies. The study revealed a disparity in chromosome position for glucosinolate biosynthesis genes between Bolbase and EnsemblPlants databases (Supplementary Table S1). Moreover, the number of nucleotides in the CDS for several glucosinolate-related genes differs between Bolbase and EnsemblPlants (Table 2). These observations suggest that further investigation and validation of those two databases are required. In a future experimentation cloning and sequencing of the mismatched CDS would be targeted. In the present study, the 84 genes identified and expressed are expected to have high similarity with Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica rapa, which have high ancestral synteny. Other than those 84 genes, a recent study revealed that bHLH04, bHLH05, and bHLH06/MYC2 factors as novel regulators of glucosinolate biosynthesis in Arabidopsis, which belong to basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors and are essential for basal glucosinolate levels and response to jasmonic acid signal pathway; GTR1 and GTR2, which are involved in glucosinolate translocation. Therefore in future investigation these three genes should be also included along with 84 genes reported in Liu et al.. A previous study compared 52 glucosinolate biosynthetic genes between A. thaliana GLS (AtGS) and the draft B. rapa genome using nucleotide BLAST analysis; high nucleotide sequence identity of about 72%-92% for the transcription factor-related genes was noted.Kim et al. studied a total of 17 transcription factor-related genes in B. rapa ssp. pekinensis involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis through aliphatic and indolic pathways in leaves, flower, stem and root. Similar to our study, expression of transcription factor-related genes was strikingly different in stem samples compared to leaves and florets. Their relative expression level, compared to the reference gene, in young leaves and flowers was much higher compared to in stem, similar to the results of the present study. In B. rapa, the highest glucosinolate content was measured in seeds and the lowest in roots and old leaves. The gene Bra035929 (encoding MYB28) in B. rapa exhibited 16- to 552-fold higher transcript levels in stems compared to seeds, young leaves and roots. Notably, the only B. oleracea orthologue of Bra035929, namely Bol036286, was expressed in all three genotypes of stem samples of kohlrabi, along with other edible organs (Figure 2). A MYB29 gene, Bol08849, an orthologue of Bra005949, which has 11- to 92-fold higher gene expression in stems of B. rapa, was expressed only in two genotypes of kale and one genotype of kohlrabi (Figure 2). These results are subject of further investigation as those genes were differentially expressed among genotypes within subspecies.Both transcription factor-related genes and glucosinolate biosynthesis genes showed differences in expression in different plant organs such as seeds, stems, leaves and flowers in previous studies. In A. thaliana, some important glucosinolate biosynthetic genes, such as CYP79B2, UGT74B1, CYP79F1, CYP79F2, IQD1, and Dof1.1, are expressed only in vascular tissues. Desulfoglucosinolate sulfotransferases (BrST) isoforms, involved in core glucosinolate biosynthesis in B. rapa, were found to be expressed in mature leaf and root highly compared to other tissues, displaying functional redundancy for differential expression. In our study, the edible organs of kohlrabi (stems) and those of cauliflower (florets) have much different types of structural and vascular tissues compared to the leaves of the other two subspecies analyzed, cabbage and kale, and hence the variation in expression of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes is expected. The fact that only one gene, namely Bol036286, out of five aliphatic transcription factor-related genes was expressed in all 12 genotypes including the stems of kohlrabi suggests that expression of this particular gene is essential in B. oleracea to induce desulfo-glucosinolates as a precursor of different aliphatic glucosinolates (Figure 2). Similarly, only one indolic transcription factor-related gene, Bol030761, was expressed in all 12 genotypes, suggesting that the presence of that gene is needed for continuation of the glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway (Supplementary Figure S1). The genes Bol025706 and Bol030092 should be essential for aglucone biosynthesis from the aliphatic and indolic glucosinolate pathways, respectively (Figure 1 and Figure 2). Expression analysis further suggests that in the aliphatic biosynthetic pathway two genes Bol031350 (FMOGS-OX5) and Bo9g006240 (AOP2) successively carry out glucosinolate transformation in the stems of kohlrabi from the primary glucosinolates glucoerucin and glucoibervirin derived from desulfo-glucosinolates produced by three ST5 genes (Figure 1, Supplementary Figure S1). Our results thus indicate that: (i) expression of all genes simultaneously is not required for glucosinolate biosynthesis in a particular organ; and (ii) the expression of a single gene or a few genes from each step is required to complete the glucosinolate biosynthesis. In addition, as in the stems of kohlrabi, expression of MYB28 and contents of aliphatic glucosinolate were detected, but expression of genes related to side-chain elongation were extremely low compared to that in other subspecies, suggesting the involvement of other transcription factors recently reported, or there is possibility that glucosinolates were transported.Glucosinolate concentrations are commonly estimated on a tissue dry weight basis. The variation in glucosinolate concentrations we found in the different edible parts might be related to the fact that leaves, stems and florets have differences in water content. Accordingly, glucosinolate concentration on a tissue fresh weight basis could be different from that on a tissue dry weight basis. Thus, the variation observed in glucosinolate content in our study comparing tissues on a dry weight basis might be explained as a methodological variation.Velasco et al. found that glucosinolate concentration in the floral parts of B. oleracea acephala subspecies greatly increases from 300 days of age, but that it decreases rapidly in the leaf samples of the same plants. In this study, we measured glucosinolate concentration only at one time point. Similar to our study, the presence of glucoiberin, sinigrin and glucobrassicin was previously reported in all different subspecies of B. oleracea. Likewise, in this study, other glucosinolates such as glucoraphanin, progoitrin, glucobrassicin, methoxyglucobrassicin, neoglucobrassicin and gluconasturtiin were also expressed in all three types of edible organs, such as in the leaves, stems and florets (Table 4). In B. oleracea var. italica, the patterns of glucosinolates were found to be mainly controlled genetically and less affected by environmental factors but several agronomic and environmental factors strongly influence the absolute content of various glucosinolates. In particular, biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates was found strongly genetically controlled in broccoli whereas that of indolic glucosinolates was controlled by genetic and environmental factors and by their interactions. For example, high nitrogen and high sulphur content were found to increase the content of indolic glucobrassicin in cabbage cultivars.Glucoraphanin and glucoiberin are the two most desirable glucosinolates from a nutritional perspective, whereas 2-hydroxy-3-butenyl (progoitrin) glucosinolate is undesirable as upon hydrolysis it produces oxazolidine-2-thione, which causes goiters in mammals and other harmful effects. Glucoraphanin and glucoiberin were found in all four subspecies (Table 4). In this study, one of the cauliflower genotype measured no progoitrin (Supplementary Table S3). Wang et al. found comparatively higher progoitrin in commercial broccoli genotypes compared to inbred lines, 1.77-6.07 mumol g-1 and reported that it contributed around 20% of the total glucosinolates measured in that subspecies. Generally, B. rapa is abundant in that undesired glucosinolate. The glucosinolates gluconapin, sinigrin, progoitrin, glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin show chemoprotective activity, but produce bitter and pungent isothiocyanates, so an excessive content might decrease consumer preference. Cauliflower florets contained all five of these glucosinolates, whereas all but gluconapin were identified in all four subspecies under study (Table 4).Among the four subspecies, the florets of cauliflower contained the highest number of glucosinolates with the lowest absolute content of progoitrin. This study thus identified that natural variation in glucosinolates and their absolute content exist among the edible organs of different B. oleracea subspecies, the results of which might be useful in breeding for glucosinolate contents or in transformation studies."}, "27043505": {"doi": "10.3390/molecules21040416", "title": "Sinigrin and Its Therapeutic Benefits", "abstract": "Sinigrin (allyl-glucosinolate or 2-propenyl-glucosinolate) is a natural aliphatic glucosinolate present in plants of the Brassicaceae family, such as broccoli and brussels sprouts, and the seeds of Brassica nigra (mustard seeds) which contain high amounts of sinigrin. Since ancient times, mustard has been used by mankind for its culinary, as well as medicinal, properties. It has been systematically described and evaluated in the classical Ayurvedic texts. Studies conducted on the pharmacological activities of sinigrin have revealed anti-cancer, antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, wound healing properties and biofumigation. This current review will bring concise information about the known therapeutic activities of sinigrin. However, the information on known biological activities is very limited and, hence, further studies still need to be conducted and its molecular mechanisms also need to be explored. This review on the therapeutic benefits of sinigrin can summarize current knowledge about this unique phytocompounds.", "intro": "1. IntroductionIt is has been well established that natural products are a rich source of compounds for purposes of drug discovery. It is estimated that more than 80% of the world's population depends on traditional medicine for the treatment of various diseases. During the past decade, it was discovered that many classes of secondary metabolites, such as glucosinolates and their hydrolysis products, have crucial bioactive(s), can be utilized as nutraceuticals, and also have therapeutic benefits. The biological actions are dependent on the levels and classes of glucosinolates present. Glucosinolates are a class of abundant secondary metabolites characteristic of the plants of the mustard family (Brassicaceae). Glucosinolates are broken down enzymatically by myrosinase, mainly into isothiocyanates, cyanides and thiocyanates which are the main bioactives, responsible for pharmacological effects. Numerous members of the Brassicaceae family have been commercialized globally, for animal and human consumption, as a rich source of nutrients and healthy products. Mustard, classified to the Brassicaceae family, is extensively consumed by humans all over.The first observations on the unique properties of glucosinolates and isothiocyanates (mustard oils) were indicated in the early 17th century and attempts were made to understand the chemical origin of the strong taste of mustard seeds. In 1959, Challenger reviewed the discovery and early history of glucosinolates as well as the involvement of the enzyme myrosinase (beta-thioglucosidase) in their conversion to isothiocyanates. Glucosinolates contains a beta-d-thioglucose group linked to a sulfonated aldoxime moiety and a variable side chain derived from amino acids (Figure 1). Glucosinolates are a class of water soluble compounds as a result of their ionized sulfate and hydrophilic thioglucose moieties and owing to their physiological properties they are not easily separated and purified.Glucosinolates have been reported to exhibit different pharmacological properties, such as antifungal, antibacterial, bioherbicidal, antioxidant, antimutagenic, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory, etc. Sinigrin is one of the glucosinolates of which the bioactivity should be explored and its known activity enhanced through optimal delivery to the human body. A number of studies have been performed on the therapeutic activities of sinigrin and revealed its anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, and wound healing effects. It is believed that the metabolic activation of sinigrin leads to the formation of isothiocyanates, which are responsible to contribute to the anti-tumor effects and other biological actions.Sinigrin is a major glucosinolate, associated with the family of glucosides present in the Brassicaceae family, such as the seeds of black mustard (Brassica nigra), brussels sprouts, and broccoli. It has been reported that Brassicaceae juncea (Indian mustard) contains significant amounts of sinigrin. Since ancient times mustard has been used as a food and has illustrated medicinal benefits in Ayurveda. The Ayurvedic tradition established mustard as a valuable herb which has therapeutic effects. For thousands of years Indian mustard seeds and its oil have been aptly used to relieve joint pain, fever, alleviate cough and colds, lessened swelling, and in cleaning the cranial cavity. Mustard oil has also been used for the treatment of various skin diseases and wounds. Scientific investigations have encouraged us to exploit this potential in a very effective manner. Sinigrin is known as the precursor of the myrosinase-mediated breakdown product allyl isothiocyanate, which exerts various biological effects and also has a vital role in the prevention of cancer and DNA damage caused by carcinogens. They have also been exploited as nutritional supplements for their preventive and medicinal benefits on various different diseases. In a study, sinigrin showed to reduce the level of plasma triglyceride, hence suggesting that alkenyl glucosinolates could be an encouraging agent to prevent postprandial hypertriglyceridemia. Figure 2 illustrates the main sources of sinigrin and gives a summary of its biological activity. In this review the therapeutic activities, such as anticancer, anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, wound healing effects, and biofumigation of sinigrin have been discussed.2. Extraction of SinigrinThe isolation and separation of glucosinolates is an extremely arduous task, due to their physicochemical properties. The existence of the sulfate group and of the thioglucose moiety results in a very low octanol-water partition coefficient (log Po/w) to fall in the low value domain, hence proposing that these classes of compounds are very hydrophilic and mostly water-soluble. Indian mustard seeds contain high amounts of sinigrin compared to the other plants of the Brassicaceae family, thus making it one of the most suitable raw materials for large scale extraction. Various extraction methods of glucosinolates have been demonstrated, including boiling water extraction and aqueous organic solvent extraction. Different parameters, such as solvent composition, particle size, temperature, and the number of required extraction steps, were optimized utilizing pressurized liquid extraction and analysis by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry in the negative ion mode.To enhance the yield of extraction of sinigrin, it is important to optimize the extraction process. Several methods of extraction of sinigrin have been endeavored. The ultrasonic-stimulated solvent extraction method was noted to be promising in improving the productivity of sinigrin. Four extraction techniques for sinigrin from Centennial (Brassica juncea L.) seeds, were compared; namely boiling water, boiling 50% (v/v) water/acetonitrile, and 100% methanol, 70% (v/v) aqueous methanol at 70  C. It was found that 50% (v/v) water/acetonitrile was the most efficient extraction solvent. A cold water extraction method was developed for extraction of sinigrin from Brassica juncea. Sinigrin has been positively identified by using (1) 1H-NMR spectroscopy. A hollow fiber microdialysis sampling, coupled to ion pair liquid chromatography, was developed for the direct determination of sinigrin without desulfation.To identify sinigrin in traditional Chinese medicine, and also determine the quality thereof, a near-infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy method was employed. Parent ion mapping analytical mass spectrometry was utilized to detect glucosinolate sinigrin. A reverse-phase HPLC method was developed for the determination of sinigrin and other various glucosinolates in traditional Chinese plants and their detection was performed by a quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometer.3. Therapeutic Benefits of Sinigrin 3.1. Anticancer Activity The potential of sinigrin to prevent the growth of cancer cells have been well established. Allyl isothiocyanate-rich mustard seed powder (MSP-1), was stably stored as its glucosinolate precursor (sinigrin) in MSP-1. On addition of water, sinigrin was readily hydrolyzed by endogenous myrosinase. Sinigrin, itself, was not bioactive, but hydrated MSP-1 caused apoptosis and G2/M phase arrest in bladder cancer cell lines in vitro. In an orthotopic rat bladder cancer model, it inhibited bladder cancer growth and blocked muscle invasion. The Jie research group studied the anti-proliferative activities of sinigrin in a model of carcinogen-induced hepatotoxicity in rats. It was found that sinigrin significantly inhibited the proliferation of liver tumor cells and the number of surface tumors in the rat liver was lessened. Sinigrin also induced apoptosis of liver cancer cells through up-regulation of the p53 and down-regulation of the Bcl-2 family members and caspases. Their findings indicated that the liver functions were gradually restored after treatment with sinigrin and it did not cause any liver toxicity. Cell cycle analysis showed that sinigrin caused cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase. The results illustrated that sinigrin displayed anti-proliferative activity in carcinogen-induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats and indicated the potential of sinigrin as an anti-cancer agent against liver cancer.In another study, Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata A. Braun) and its glucosinolate sinigrin were tested in the in vitro HL60 (human promyelocytic leukaemia cell line) and in vivo Drosophila melanogaster systems to determine the anti-mutagenic and anti-proliferative properties. The antitumor activity of the B. carinata and, its major glucosinolates, sinigrin was determined by measuring the relative inhibitory capacity of tumors growing in HL60 cells. B. carinata showed a dose-response curve with a high tumoricide activity in HL60 cells (IC50 value of 0.28 mg mL-1). Single sinigrin to the cell medium did not produce cytotoxic effects. When sinigrin was hydrolyzed by the enzyme myrosinase by addition to it, exhibited anti-proliferative activity (hydrolyzed sinigrin IC50 = 2.71 muM). They also studied the anti-genotoxicity and the results obtained contributed to the health properties of B. carinata and sinigrin in DNA protection. The percentage of inhibition of B. carinata and sinigrin when are assayed against H2O2. The addition of plant samples to the fly food produced anti-mutagenic effects. Both of them showed a high desmutagenic and recombinogenic potency. The lowest concentrations assayed for B. carinata plant samples showed more anti-genotoxic effects than those of higher (78.46% clone inhibition). For sinigrin, the highest anti-genotoxic effect displayed percentage of inhibition of clone formation of 84.61%.Investigations were conducted on the inhibition of dimethylhydrazine-induced aberrant crypt foci and induction of apoptosis in the rat colon, following oral administration of the glucosinolate sinigrin to rats for three months. An increase in apoptosis in colonic crypts was displayed, when exposed to the carcinogen. There was no significant induction of apoptosis in rats when sinigrin, alone, was fed; however, sinigrin administered after dimethylhydrazine suppressed the induction of aberrant crypt foci. This may be due to increased apoptotic deletion of damaged stem cells in the crypts of rats with treated sinigrin.The activity of sinigrin indole-3-carbinol (I3C) on DNA methylation in target tissues of tobacco-specific nitrosamine 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) tumorigenesis, and also the effect of dietary sinigrin on NNK tumorigenicity were assessed in a two-year bioassay in F344 rats. The study reported that sinigrin decreased 7-methylguanine formation in hepatic DNA, but had no effect on 7-methylguanine levels of lung or nasal mucosa DNA. I3C increased 7-methylguanine levels in hepatic DNA, but decreased DNA methylation in lung and nasal mucosa. The bioassay, suggested that sinigrin had no effects on NNK tumorigenesis in the target tissues, but sinigrin plus NNK displayed significant incidence of pancreatic tumors than in the NNK treated alone. This study concluded that, absence of any inhibitory effect of sinigrin on NNK hepatic cells tumorigenesis, could be due factors other than DNA methylation and O6-methylguanine repair which can be considered in evaluating the effects of dietary compounds on NNK hepatic tumorigenesis, and also stated that the contrary effects on NNK-induced hepatic DNA-methylation by sinigrin and I3C shows the complexities of dietary modulation of carcinogenesis.In another study, the effects of sinigrin and indole-3-carbinol (I3C) on the hepatocarcinogenesis induced by diethyl-nitrosamine (DEN) were studied in male ACI/N rats. When rats where treated with diethyl-nitrosamine and diet containing 1200 ppm. Sinigrin and rats fed with rats where treated with diethyl-nitrosamine and diet containing 1000 ppm. (I3C), the incidences of iron-excluding altered foci, liver cell tumors, and the tumor multiplicity were significantly smaller than when rats when treated only with diethyl-nitrosamine. This study suggested that sinigrin and indole-3-carbinol inhibited the hepatocarcinogenesis induced by diethyl-nitrosamine when delivered concurrently with the carcinogen.The inhibitory effects of indole-3-carbinol (I3C) and sinigrin during initiation and promotion phases of 4-Nitroquinoline 1-oxide-induced rat tongue carcinogenesis were demonstrated in male ACI/N rats. Both I3C and sinigrin treated during initiation and post initiation phase suppressed preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions of the tongue epithelium induced by 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide. It also caused significant decreased in the number and area of silver-stained nucleolar organizer regions protein, they are known as indices of cell proliferation effects. The results indicated that I3C and sinigrin inhibited rat tongue carcinogenesis in both the initiation and post initiation phases, followed by treatment with 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide. They suggested that the mechanism by which by which I3C and sinigrin displayed their inhibitory actions on tongue carcinoma was not clear but it could be related to the actions these compounds on the metabolic activation, formation of DNA adduct, detoxification of 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide or formation of radicals.Few speculations for the mechanisms of the anti-carcinogenesis activity of glucosinolates have been recognized. The mechanism of the anti-carcinogenesis activity of glucosinolates is unknown. Blocking effects are believed to involve modulation of enzymes, which can reduce exposure of target tissues to DNA damage. Isothiocyanates have shown to induce the activity of phase II enzymes, including glutathione S-transferase and quinone reductase, in the small intestinal mucosa and liver, and also to block chemical carcinogenesis. Increased consumption of brassica vegetables induces glutathione S-transferase in humans and increased protection against cancer. Another speculated mechanism of anti-carcinogenesis is suppression of tumor development following the initiation of pre-cancerous cells. Other mechanisms of suppression are the deletion of initiated cells from genetically-damaged tissue by apoptosis.Recently, our research group tested the effect of sinigrin on melanoma cells (A-375) and in normal human keratinocytes (HaCaT). We also investigated the use of a vesicular carrier system called phytosomes, to encapsulate sinigrin and determine whether the phytosome complex could enhance the effects of sinigrin on melanoma cells. Our results indicated that sinigrin alone, at higher concentration, displayed about 46% toxicity, whilst the sinigrin-phytosome complex inhibited cytotoxicity by 74%. These findings suggested that the sinigrin-phytosome complex did enhance the cytotoxic effects of sinigrin. It was noteworthy that sinigrin and its phytosome complex displayed minimal toxicity towards HaCaT cells. When the anticancer effects of sinigrin were studied by other researchers, it was noticed they exhibited strong anticancer activity. Although the phytosome formulation increased its activity at higher concentration, sinigrin did not exhibit much cytotoxic effect towards A-375 melanoma cells. 3.2. Anti-Inflammatory ActivitySinigrin's effect on the production of inflammatory mediators in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW 264.7 macrophages, have been examined by Lee. They investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of sinigrin on nitrite oxide (NO) and pro-inflammatory cytokine production by utilizing colorimetric and ELISA assay. By using Western blot assays the researchers also examined the expression of MAPK, NLRP-3, and p65. The results indicated that sinigrin did not reduced the NO production, but sinigrin inhibited the levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Sinigrin blocked phosphorylation of JNK and p38, but not ERK. Sinigrin treatment significantly suppressed the expression of p65 and NLRP-3. These results revealed sinigrin has potential anti-inflammatory activity, which may result from the inhibition of MAPK phosphorylation, expression of NLRP-3 and p65, and also lowers the production of pro-inflammatory mediators. The effectiveness of sinigrin against atherosclerosis (chronic inflammatory disease) in ApoE-deficient mice was studied. Sinigrin exhibited significant repressive effects on the expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 in ApoE mice. It also mitigated the level of oxLDL, HDL, LDH, triglyceride, and cholesterol in serum. The serum levels of sterol-regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2), oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), and liver X receptors (LXRs) were reduced by sinigrin; it also decreased the serum levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha. It can, therefore, be concluded that sinigrin has anti-atherosclerotic activity. Lee and Lee studied the effect of sinigrin on the expression of the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) in TNF-alpha-induced vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). The data suggested that sinigrin suppressed the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB induced by TNF-alpha. Through the suppression of NF-kappaB signaling pathways, sinigrin inhibited the TNF-alpha-stimulated VCAM-1 expression. The result from the two above studies, it can be concluded that sinigrin acts as an anti-atherosclerosis therapeutic agent.3.3. Antibacterial ActivityGlucosinolate hydrolysis products are potent inhibitors of bacterial activity. Sinigrin is not usually antimicrobial; when it is enzymatically hydrolyzed to form allyl isothiocyanate it exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against food spoilage and pathogenic organisms. Allyl isothiocyanate showed minimum inhibitory concentrations as 25 microL/L at pH 4.5 with greater antimicrobial activity at low pH value than at high pH 8.5 against Escherichia coli O157:H7. This indicated a gradual reduction of the antimicrobial activity when the pH was raised. Hence, it was suggested that allyl isothiocyanate could work better in more acid foods. The speculated mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of isothiocyanates could be related to intracellular inactivation of sulphydryl-enzymes; this was concluded from the observations, where proteins and sulphydryl compounds were able to suppress the antimicrobial effects of diverse isothiocyanates. The thioredoxin system is known for its essential role in DNA synthesis. It has shown the capability of allyl isothiocyanate in crossing the plasma membrane and reaching the cytoplasm of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. Hence, suggesting that the antibacterial activity of allyl isothiocyanate could be related to the inhibition of DNA synthesis. Allyl isothiocyanate is known to inhibit the catalysis of thioredoxin reductase and acetate kinase, which are responsible for important metabolic reactions in bacteria. Thus, it can be proposed that allyl isothiocyanate have many targeted antimicrobial activity, as they can cause enzymatic inhibition and membrane damage.The antimicrobial activity of residual endogenous plant myrosinase in Oriental and yellow mustard powders and a deoiled meal (which contained more glucosinolate than unextracted mustard powder of each type of mustard), against E. coli O15:H7 during dry-fermented sausage ripening was investigated. It was noticed that when 4% (w/w) deodorized yellow mustard powder containing myrosinase from hot mustard was added to the sausages, ripening required between 18 and 24 d to reduce E. coli O157:H7 numbers. The 2% (w/w) deoiled yellow mustard meal treatment containing myrosinase activity was as potently antimicrobial as 4% yellow mustard powder and took 21 d to obtain the reduction. A significant difference in bactericidal activity was noticed between yellow and Oriental mustard treatments, where yellow mustard was more antimicrobial. This may be due to the yellow mustard contained higher glucosinolate levels than Oriental mustard. It was believed that myrosinase activity contributed to the high antimicrobial actions of mustard when used in sausage against E. coli O157:H7 through its hydrolysis of glucosinolates. In a study by Herzallah and Holley, evaluated the use of carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) nanoparticulate on the antimicrobial activity of CMC films containing sinigrin against E. coli O157:H7 on fresh beef. The study indicated that the films with nanoparticulation that contain sinigrin in oriental mustard significantly exhibited more antimicrobial activity than films without nanoparticulation. Hence it was concluded that the nanopartiulation of CMC significantly enhanced the antimicrobial effects of the films having sinigrin.Sinigrin and its degradation products, such as allyl isothiocyanate, allyl cyanide (AC), 1-cyano-2,3-epithiopropane (CETP), and allyl thiocyanate (ATC), were tested for antibacterial activity on nine species of bacteria and eight species of yeasts. The results gained from this study indicated that sinigrin, AC, and CETP at 1000 ppm were not inhibitory to any bacteria or yeast growth and allyl isothiocyanate was the most inhibitory of the sinigrin hydrolysis products. Brabban and Edwards reported that sinigrin was found to be innocuous to all the organisms being tested but its hydrolysis products exhibited inhibitory effects of growth. In this investigation rapemeal, containing potentially toxic compounds; glucosinolates, was examined as a substrate for the growth of micro-organisms. Before its hydrolysis the initial inhibitory sinigrin concentration was found to be species-dependent with Bacillus subtilis being the most resistant (80 mug mL-1) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (40 mug mL-1) the most sensitive one. Three Gram-positive organisms tested were found to be more resistant to hydrolysis products than other micro-organisms. It was observed in rapemeal media growth inhibition was dependent on the glucosinolate content of the rapemeal.In an investigation by Lara-Lledo and their group, the ability of Listeria monocytogenes to convert glucosinolates present in deodorized oriental and yellow mustard, as well as pure sinigrin, into their respective isothiocyanates during in vitro study and on sliced bologna vaccum-packed with polyvinyl polyethylene glycol graft copolymer packaging films. During broth tests with deodorized (myrosinase-inactivated) mustard extracts or with purified sinigrin inhibition was only displayed when exogenous myrosinase was added. It was noticed that when pure sinigrin, oriental or yellow mustard extracts were incorporated in films containing 3%, 5%, and 6% (w/w) of the corresponding glucosinolate and used to package bologna inoculated with L monocytogenes., the pathogen was found in bologna packed with the oriental mustard extract. The yellow mustard extract exerted less inhibition and the pure sinigrin did not show antimicrobial activity.3.4. Antifungal ActivityThe potential of members of the Brassicaceae family have been shown to produce significant quantities of antifungal compounds in roots. The results indicated the glucosinolate-mediated resistance to fungi in the roots of Brassica species. Investigations by Ocampo, have indicated that extracts from the roots of various Brassica species and reactions of the glucosinolate sinigrin with myrosinase inhibited the germination of Glomus mosseae spores. The fungitoxicity of allyl-isothiocyanate vapour against Penicillium expansum, the agent of blue mould on pears, was studied and it was observed that the use of allyl-isothiocyanate produced from pure sinigrin (Brassica juncea) was effective and an alternative to synthetic fungicides against P. expansum.3.5. Antioxidant ActivityThe Ippoushi research group have demonstrated the sinigrin antioxidant activity. It is known that allyl isothiocyanate is produced from sinigrin and this suppresses nitric oxide production and the induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase in lipopolysaccharide-activated J774.1 macrophages. Myrosinase, in cruciferous vegetables, is not activated at the time of processes of cooking and, therefore, cannot produce allyl isothiocyanate from sinigrin, thus sinigrin is mainly taken by human beings and not allyl isothiocyanate. They tried to demonstrate the in vivo suppressive effect of sinigrin administration on nitric oxide formation induced lipopolysaccharide administration. Their study was performed to assay the levels of urinary nitrate + nitrite and allyl isothiocyanate in rats. The results indicated that the intake of sinigrin significantly reduced urinary levels of nitrate + nitrite, an index of nitric oxide production in lipopolysaccharide treated rats. It also revealed that sinigrin has antioxidative properties and lowers the level of reactive nitrogen species. Generally reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species are known to be involved in the multistage carcinogenesis process.3.6. Wound Healing ActivityThe wound healing properties of sinigrin were not previously studied. Our research group recently, for the first time, revealed that sinigrin has the potential to also cure wounds. The in vitro wound healing activity was tested on normal human keratinocytes (HaCaT). Sinigrin was also formulated using a vesicular system called phytosome. The findings suggested that the sinigrin-phytosome complex enhanced the wound healing actions of sinigrin. The effects of sinigrin and its phytosome formulations were studied at two different concentrations. It was observed that, at lower concentration of 0.07 mg/mL, the sinigrin-phytosome complex displayed 79%, whilst sinigrin showed only 50% of wound closure. At the higher concentration 0.14 mg/mL the sinigrin-phytosome complex completely cured the wound (100%), whereas the sinigrin alone displayed only 71% wound healing. These results confirmed the wound healing activity of sinigrin, which was also augmented by encapsulation in the phytosome delivery system. 3.7. BiofumigationGlucosinolates and their breakdown products, like isothiocyanates, have attained attraction as possibility of using them as natural \"pesticides\" in a process called biofumigation, that helps to reduce soil-borne pests and pathogens by placing plants of the Brassicales order into the soil. The reactive isothiocyanates are formed enzymatically from glucosinolates and after tissue disruption glucosinolates are hydrolyzed by thioglucosidase (myrosinase), a beta-d-thioglucosidase that cleaves \"beta-d-glucose. The yielded aglycone degrades to form isothiocyanates, thiocyanates, nitriles, epithionitriles, and oxazolidine 2-thione. However, the non-enzymatic thermal degradation of glucosinolates could produce chemical species identical to products of enzymatic hydrolysis. The breakdown products are relatively small molecules making many of them volatiles and have been shown to behave as attractants for insects for seeking food or egg-laying sites rather than acting as a direct insecticide. Enzymatic decomposition of allyl glucosinolate (sinigrin) breaks down in soils to allyl isothiocyanate and allyl cyanide, allyl nitrile and these breakdown products and glucosinolate-containing plant tissues have been utilized in controlling soil-borne plant pests.Lethality test using Caenorhabditis elegans was used to assess toxicity of glucosinolates and their enzymatic breakdown products. It was observed that in the absence of the enzyme thioglucosidase (myrosinase) sinigrin was found to be nontoxic at all concentrations, but addition of thioglucosidase increased toxicity by two orders of magnitude, thus suggesting it can be used as an effective nematicide.In a study by Pratt research group, aphids were supplied as a food source to two species of polyphagous ladybird, Adalia bipunctata and Coccinella septempunctata. When Brassica nigra diets containing 0.2% sinigrin, was fed to First instar A. bipunctata, it was unable to survive, but when fed aphids reared on diets having 0% sinigrin, it was observed that the survival rates were higher. First instar Coccinella septempunctata survived when fed with aphids reared on Brassica nigra having up to 1% sinigrin. It was noteworthy that the presence of sinigrin in the aphid diet decreased the growth of larvae and increased the time period needed for larvae to reach second instar for this species of ladybird. These results indicated that the presence of sinigrin in the diet of Brassica nigra makes this aphid not suitable as a food source for Adalia bipunctata.The uptake of a glucosinolate (sinigrin) was investigated when aphids fed on plants. In nymphs of the wingless aphid morph, glucosinolate levels continued to increase throughout the development to the adult stage, but the quantity in nymphs of the winged form peaked before eclosion and then declined. Winged aphids excreted significantly higher amounts of glucosinolate in the honeydew in comparison to wingless aphids. The study suggested that the higher level of sinigrin in wingless aphids had a highly negative impact on survival of a ladybird predator. Larvae of Adalia bipunctata were not able to survive when a 1% sinigrin diet was fed to adult wingless aphids. It survived successfully when fed aphids from a glucosinolate-free diet."}, "27322230": {"doi": "10.3390/molecules21060787", "title": "Expression Profiling of Glucosinolate Biosynthetic Genes in Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata Inbred Lines Reveals Their Association with Glucosinolate Content", "abstract": "Glucosinolates are the biochemical compounds that provide defense to plants against pathogens and herbivores.

The possible association between glucosinolate accumulation and related gene expression level was explored by principal component analysis (PCA). The genotype-dependent variation in the relative expression level of different aliphatic and indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis genes is the novel result of this study. A total of eight different types of glucosinolates, including five aliphatic and three indolic glucosinolates, was detected in four cabbage lines.

PCA revealed that a higher expression level of ST5b genes and lower expression of GSL-OH was associated with the accumulation of these three aliphatic glucosinolate compounds. PCA further revealed that comparatively higher accumulation of neoglucobrassicin in the inbred line, BN4072, was associated with a high level of expression of MYB34 (Bol017062) and CYP81F1 genes. The Dof1 and IQD1 genes probably trans-activated the genes related to biosynthesis of glucoerucin and methoxyglucobrassicin for their comparatively higher accumulation in the BN4059 and BN4072 lines compared to the other two lines, BN3273 and BN3383. A comparatively higher progoitrin level in BN3273 was probably associated with the higher expression level of the GSL-OH gene. The cabbage inbred line BN3383 accounted for the significantly higher relative expression level for the 12 genes out of 48, but this line had comparatively lower total glucosinolates detected compared to the other three cabbage lines. The reason for the genotypic variation in gene expression and glucosinolate accumulation is a subject of further investigation.", "intro": "1. IntroductionCabbage, one the most important vegetable crops throughout the world, is a member of the vegetable species Brassica oleracea that contains a wide variety of glucosinolates. The subspecies B. oleracea var. capitata produced 12 different kinds of glucosinolates in its edible organ, including eight types of aliphatic, three types of indolic and one type of aromatic glucosinolates in the Korean cabbage varieties. Cabbage is an important ingredient in many important Korean and Chinese dishes. This subspecies was found to produce glucoerucin, which was absent in the edible organs of kale, kohlrabi and cauliflower. However, the number of glucosinolates present in cabbage was found to be variable in different studies. This is probably because the content and type of glucosinolates in cabbage subspecies varies between growing season, anthocyanin content and leaf age and also between tissue types: roots, shoots, etc. The content and varieties of glucosinolates also widely varies in the edible organ between different cultivars of this subspecies probably because of the variation in tissue types. Despite a large number of studies reporting that glucosinolate content and types had intra-subspecific variation in cabbage varieties, the associated gene involved in such variation has not been well elucidated.The biosynthetic pathways of glucosinolates and the break-down of these biomolecules follow species level variation, especially since these pathways are quite different in the vegetable species B. oleracea compared to those in Arabidopsis and B. rapa. B. oleracea has greater diversity compared to B. rapa and B. napus. B. oleracea has about 84 glucosinolate biosynthesis genes and 22 catabolism-related genes. A recent study explored two available web sources, Bolbase and EnesmblPlants, to compile the coding DNA sequences of glucosinolate biosynthesis-related genes and then catalogued reverse-transcript PCR-based semi-quantitative expression profiling of 84 genes in the edible organs of four B. oleracea subspecies, including cabbage leaf samples. The authors reported that the biosynthesis of 12 diversified types of glucosinolates was not dependent on the expression of all 84 genes in the cabbage subspecies. Rather, the expression of one of a few genes (probably the key regulatory genes) in each step of glucosinolate biosynthesis might result in the accumulation of a particular glucosinolate in the edible organs of different B. oleracea subspecies. Glucosinolate biosynthesis generally follows a characteristic three-step process. The process commences with the addition and elongation of side chains composed of methylene groups to the amino acid molecules. The second and third steps are the core structure formation and modification in the side chains of the elongated amino acid chain, respectively. The modification of side chains is accomplished by oxidation, hydroxylation, methoxylation, sulfation and glycosylation, processes that involve different genes. The initial amino acid precursors of glucosinolate biosynthesis are generally methionine (or alanine, leucine, isoleucine and valine) for aliphatic glucosinolates and tryptophan and phenylalanine (or tyrosine), respectively, for indolic and aromatic glucosinolates (Figure 1).In Arabidopsis, the amino acid side chain elongation begins by the action of methylthioalkylmalate synthase (MAM) in association with acid: sodium symporter family protein 5 (BASS5) and branched-chain aminotransferase (BCAT) at the beginning of glucosinolate biosynthesis. The next step is the formation of the core structure, which is a five-step process, including: (i) aldoxime formation by cytochromes P450 of the CYP79 and CYP83 families; (ii) aldoxime oxidation to nitrile oxides or aci-nitro compounds by cytochromes P450 of the CYP83 family; (iii) thiohydroximic acid formation by C-S cleavage; (iv) desulfoglucosinolate formation by S-glucosyltransferase; and (v) the formation of glucosinolates by sulfotransferase. The desulfoglucosinolates undergoes secondary modifications to produce particular glucosinolate biomolecules that involve several gene loci, for example: GS-OX, GS-AOP, GS-OH are involved in aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis, and CYP81, IGM are involved in indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis (Figure 1). MYB-transcription factor-related genes trans-activate the functions of several genes involved in side chain elongation and core-structure formation (Figure 1). A few other transcription factor-related genes other than MYB, such as TFL2, IQD1 and Dof1.1, also trans-activate both aliphatic and indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis. In cabbage subspecies, expression profiling of none of those genes was studied to elucidate any intra-subspecies variation in gene expression. The present study therefore was conducted to explore the quantitative expression profiling of glucosinolate biosynthesis in four different cabbage inbred lines with variation in morphological appearance. The glucosinolates present in inbred lines were detected, and their contents were also quantified. An association between the glucosinolate biosynthesis-related gene and the glucosinolate content was explored.", "results": "2. Results and Discussion2.1. Genotypic Variation in the Relative Expression Profiling of Glucosinolate Biosynthesis GenesThis study investigated the relative expression level of a total of 48 genes related to glucosinolate biosynthesis in B. oleracea var. capitata in four inbred lines, BN3273, BN3383, BN4059 and BN4072 (Figure 2) with contrasting morphological variations (Figure 2). The external morphological variations include variation in leaf shape and appearance (Figure 2). Moreover, none of those four inbred lines had any common parents according to Asia Seed Company (Seoul, Korea). The color of the leaves of BN3273 and BN3383 was pale green, and that of BN4059 and BN4072 was green (Figure 2). While calculating the relative expression level of different genes, the inbred line BN3273 was considered as the control. The inbred line BN3383 accounted for a remarkably higher level of relative gene expression for the MYB29 transcription factor-related gene associated with aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis compared to the other three lines (Figure 3, Table S2). MYB28 accession Bol036286 recorded the lowest level of gene expression for the same line compared to the other three lines (Figure 3, Table S2). The inbred line BN4072 accounted for a comparatively lower expression level of MYB28 accessions Bol007795 and Bol017019 and MYB29 accession Bol008849 compared to BN4059 (Figure 3, Table S2).The inbred line BN4072 accounted for, remarkably, more than a six-fold, higher level of gene expression for the indolic transcription factor-related gene MYB34 accession Bol017062 compared to the control line BN3273 (Figure 3, Table S2). Another line BN4059 accounted for a seven-fold higher expression level compared to the control line BN3273 (Figure 3, Table S2). The same line had about a three-fold higher level of expression for the MYB34 (Bol007760) gene (Figure 3, Table S2). The inbred line BN3383 had a comparatively higher level of expression for three Dof1 genes associated with both aliphatic and indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis compared to the three other lines (Figure 3, Table S2). Another transcription factor-related gene associated with both aliphatic and indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis, TFL2 accession Bol034445, was highly expressed in both BN3383 and BN4059 lines compared to the other two cabbage inbred lines (Figure 3, Table S2).The inbred line BN3383 accounted for a high level of gene expression up to two-fold for the following aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis genes: ST5c accession Bol030757, FMOGS-OX2 accession Bol010993, FMOGS-OX5 accessions Bol031350 and Bol029100; compared to the control line BN3273 (Figure 4, Table S2). Inbred lines BN4059 and BN4072 accounted for a strikingly lower expression level of ST5b accession Bol026201 compared to the other two lines, BN3383 and BN3273 (Figure 4, Table S2). The gene AOP2 (Bol9g006240.1) had more than a seven-fold lower level of relative gene expression in the inbred line BN3383 compared to the control line BN3273 (Figure 4, Table S2). Another aliphatic transcription factor-related gene GSL-OH (Bol033373) had more than an eight-fold higher expression level in the inbred line BN4059 (Figure 4, Table S2).Four indolic biosynthesis-related gene accessions, namely ST5a (Bol039395), CYP81F2 (Bol012237), CYP81F2 (Bol014239) and CYP81F3 (Bol028919), accounted for approximately a two-fold higher level of gene expression for the cabbage line BN3383 compared to the control line BN3273 (Figure 5, Table S2). The inbred line BN4059 coupled with BN3383 accounted for approximately a four-fold higher expression level of the CYP81F3 (Bol028919) and CYP81F4 (Bol032714) genes compared to the two other cabbage lines (Figure 5, Table S2). The relative expression level of CYP81F4 (Bol032712) and CYP81F4 (Bol028918) was significantly higher in the BN4059 and BN4072 lines compared to the other two inbred lines (Figure 5, Table S2). The line BN4072 accounted for more than a 90-fold and a 60-fold higher level of gene expression of CYP81F1 accessions Bol017376 and Bol017375, respectively, compared to the control line BN3273 (Figure 5, Table S2). Another cabbage line, BN4059, accounted for the highest expression level of CYP81F1 (Bol028914) gene, about 80-fold compared to the three other lines (Figure 5). The relative expression level of CYP81F1 accessions Bol017376 and Bol0128913 was comparatively higher in cabbage lines BN4059 and BN4072 compared to BN3273 and BN3383 (Figure 5, Table S2).The glucosinolate break-down-related gene TGG5 (Bol031599) was expressed highly in the inbred lines BN4059 and BN4072 compared to BN3273 and BN3383 (Figure 5, Table S2). The level of expression of two other break-down-related genes, TGG1 (Bol017328) and TGG2 (Bol025706) in the BN4059 and BN4072 lines, was remarkably low compared to the BN3273 and BN3383 lines (Figure 5, Table S2).2.2. Genotypic Variation in Glucosinolate ContentsHPLC analysis detected a total of eight types of glucosinolate molecules in four cabbage inbred lines (Figure 6). Those were progoitrin, glucoraphanin, sinigrin, gluconapin, glucoerucin, 4-hydroxy-glucobrassicin (4HGBS), methoxy-glucobrassicin (MGBS) and neoglucobrassicin (NGBS). However, three aliphatic glucosinolates, glucoraphanin, sinigrin and gluconapin, were detected only in the cabbage line BN3273 (Figure 6). The same line also had comparatively higher amounts of 4HGBS and total glucosinolate, but lower MGBS compared to the other three lines (Figure 6, Table S3). Only two other aliphatic glucosinolates, progoitrin and glucoerucin, were detected in all four lines (Figure 6). 4HGBS, MGBS and NGBS are the three indolic glucosinolates that were detected in all four inbred lines (Figure 6). Unlike the relative expression level of a notable number of genes, the cabbage inbred line BN3383 did not have a higher amount of glucosinolates compared to the other three lines (Figure 6). The inbred line BN4059 had the highest content of progoitrin (Figure 6, Table S3), whereas BN4072 had the highest content of NGBS (Figure 6).2.3. Association between Glucosinolate Content and Gene Expression2.3.1. Association between Aliphatic Glucosinolate Content and Transcription Factor-Related GenesThe association between glucosinolate content and the relative gene expression level was explored through principal component analysis (PCA). In principal component 1 (PC1), the aliphatic transcription factor-related genes and glucosinolate content accounted for a negative contrast (Table 1). The coefficient for MYB genes was positive (except Bol036286), and those for glucoraphanin, sinigrin, gluconapin and glucoerucin content were negative (Table 1). This contrast is largely explained by the significant genotypic variation between the BN3383, BN4059, BN4072 lines and the BN3273 line, as only the BN3273 line contained glucoraphanin, sinigrin and gluconapin (Table 1). PC2 accounted for 23.3% of the data variation and estimated a larger contrast between BN4059, BN4072 and BN3273, BN3383 for a higher content of glucoraphanin, sinigrin and gluconapin, a lower content of glucoerucin and vice versa in association with the expression level of MYB genes (Table 1). The PC3 explaining 15.3% of the data variation accounted for a positive association between higher progoitrin content in line BN4059 and a higher expression level of MYB28 accession Bol007795 (Table 1).2.3.2. Association between Indolic Glucosinolate Content and Transcription Factor-Related GenesPC1 obtained from a PCA for the indolic glucosinolate content and transcription factor-related genes accounted for 34.3% of the data variation, but the coefficients of this PC were dominated by the higher expression of MYB34 (Bol007760) and MYB51 (Bol030761) genes in BN4059 and BN3383 inbred lines compared to the other two genotypes (Table 2). PC2 accounted for a positive association between NGBS content and the relative expression level of the MYB34 (Bol017062) gene (Table 2). This contrast is largely explained by the higher NGBS content and simultaneously higher expression level of MYB34 (Bol017062) gene in the BN4059 line compared to BN3273 (Table 2). PC2 in Table S4 indicated a notable contrast between the BN4059, BN4072 lines and the BN3273 and BN3383 lines for contrasting higher and lower content of glucoerucin and MGBS, respectively (Figure 6). This variation was largely explained by the contrasting expression level of the Dof1 (Bol041144), Dof1 (Bol006511) and IQD1 (Bol023096) genes (Table S4). Part of this variation is also explained by the absence of glucoraphanin, sinigrin and gluconapin in the BN4059 and BN4072 lines (Table S4).2.3.3. Association between Aliphatic Glucosinolate Content and Biosynthesis-Related GenesPC1 accounted for a positive association among the higher level of expression of ST5b genes and the lower level of expression of GSL-OH (Bol033373) in BN3273 and their association with the content of glucoraphanin, sinigrin and gluconapin (Table 3). PC2, which explained 31.8% of the data variation, was largely influenced by the higher level of expression of the ST5c and FMOGS-OX genes in BN3383 (Table 3). PC3 accounted for 17.1% of the data variation, indicating that higher progoitrin accumulation in the line BN4059 might be associated with the higher expression level of GSL-OH (Bol033373) and the lower expression level of the AOP2 (Bo2g102190) gene compared to the BN4072 line (Table 3, Figure 4 and Figure 6).2.3.4. Association between Indolic Glucosinolate Content and Biosynthesis-Related GenesPC1 in another PCA between indolic glucosinolate content explained 35.1% of the data variation (Table S5). This PC highlighted a contrast in the expression level of most of the indolic biosynthesis-related genes in BN3273 (generally having a lower expression level) compared to the other three lines (Figure 5, Table S5). BN3273 had a comparatively lower expression level for all indolic biosynthesis-related genes compared to the other three lines (Figure 5). The variation explained by PC2 was dominated by the higher expression level of CYP81F1 accessions Bol017376, Bol017375 and Bol028913 and the lower expression level of CYP81F2, CYP81F2 and ST5a (Bol026200) in BN4072 compared to the other two lines, BN3273 and BN4072 (Figure 5, Table S5). The variation in PC2 is largely accounted for by the strikingly higher expression of level of CYP81F1 genes in the inbred line BN4072 (Table S5). PC3, explaining 16.6% of the data variation, is dominated by the higher NGBS content in BN4072 and BN3383 compared to the other two lines (Table S5).2.4. DiscussionThe present study investigated the relative gene expression level of 48 genes from the aliphatic and indolic metabolic pathways of glucosinolate biosynthesis and also estimated the content of glucosinolate in four inbred lines of cabbage with contrasting morphological variation (Figure 2). Only one out of four genotypes, BN3273, had three aliphatic glucosinolates detected, glucoraphanin, sinigrin and gluconapin. The cabbage inbred lines BN3383, BN4059 and BN4072 had none of those three aliphatic glucosinolates. This genotype-specific variation was associated with the expression level of some key genes. PCA analysis between the expression level of aliphatic glucosinolate contents and the relative expression level of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis-related genes indicated that the existence of glucoraphanin, sinigrin and gluconapin might be associated with the comparatively higher level of expression of ST5b genes and the lower expression level of GSL-OH genes in BN3273 (Table 3, Figure 4). Thus, in the inbred lines BN3383, BN4059 and BN4072, the non-existence of glucoraphanin, sinigrin and gluconapin might be associated with the lower level of expression of the ST5b genes (Table 3, Figure 4). The non-existence of those three aliphatic glucosinolates in the BN4059 and BN4072 lines might also be associated with the level of transactivation of ST5b genes by the following transcription factor-related genes: MYB28 (Bol007795), MYB28 (Bol017019), MYB28 (Bol036743) and MYB29 (Bol008849) (Table 1). Such transactivation of ST5b genes by the MYB transcription factors has been discussed by Variyar et al..Two separate PCs involving indolic transcription factor-related and biosynthesis genes (PC2 in Table 2 and Table S5, respectively) indicated that a notably higher expression level of the MYB34 (Bol017062) gene (Figure 3) is associated with trans-activation of the expression of the CYP81F1 (Bol017375, Bol017376, Bol028913) genes (Figure 5) in the inbred line BN4072 for a comparatively higher accumulation of MGBS and NGBS in that particular line (Figure 6). On the other hand, the strikingly higher level of expression of CYP81F1 (Bol028914) and two IGMT1 genes was associated with comparatively lower content of NGBS in another line, BN4059 (Table S5).The HPLC analysis in this study only detected eight types of glucosinolates; those included no aromatic glucosinolate compound (Figure 6). In our previous study, we detected a total of 12 glucosinolates, including glucoiberverin (GIV), glucoiberin (GIB), glucobrassicanapin (GBN), glucoraphanin (GRE), glucobrassicin (GBS) and gluconasturtiin (GST, an aromatic glucosinolate), in cabbage subspecies. None of those six glucosinolates were detected in this study. However, in this study, we detected 4HGBS, which is a very close intermediate glucosinolate compound of GBS. The reason behind this variation might be related to the genetic variations of different cabbage genotypes, environmental variation or may be partly related to the HPLC procedure.A high level of gene expression of the TGG2 (Bol028319) break-down-related gene in the cabbage inbred line BN3383 suggested that break-down of glucosinolate molecules is also high in that inbred line compared to the other three lines (Figure 5). In contrast, the lowest level of expression of TGG1 (Bol017328) and TGG2 (Bol025706) in inbred lines BN4059 and BN4072 suggested a lower level of break-down of glucosinolate molecules compared to the two other inbred lines, although a contrasting expression level was observed for the TGG5 gene (Figure 5). The lower level of expression of break-down-related genes might be associated with the lower level of the defense capacity of the BN4059 and BN4072 lines against herbivory and microbial attack.One of the notable observations in this study is that out of a the total of 48 genes, 12 genes accounted for a significantly higher level of gene expression in a particular line, BN3383, compared to the other three cabbage lines (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5). However, none of the eight detected glucosinolate molecules were higher in content in BN3383 compared to the other three lines (Figure 6). The reason behind such variation is a subject of further investigation. However, a lower level of glucosinolate in that particular line might be associated with enhanced glucosinolate break-down through the elevated expression of TGG2 genes (Figure 5). Moreover, sequence variants are another possible explanation, and intuitively, the other includes various protein levels due to post-transcriptional modifications and various levels of enzymatic activities regulated at the post-translational level, which would be specific for the line BN3383.The general role of the constitutive glucosinolate molecules is providing defense to plants from insects and microbes by their anti-oxidative properties. A notable number of previous studies confirmed that the content of glucosinolates varies between genotypes of cabbage. However, none of those previous studies explored the genetic background of such variation. The reason behind the higher or lower level of gene expression in different cabbage genotypes and associated variation in glucosinolate accumulation is a subject of further variation. Intuitively, there might have been variation in the functional component within the gene sequence, including the presence of the InDel (insertion or deletion) in the base sequence, single nucleotide polymorphism, etc., and also there may be variation in enzymatic activities regulated at the post-translational level."}, "37462091": {"doi": "10.1021/acs.jafc.3c03246", "title": "New Insights into the Plutella xylostella Detoxifying Enzymes: Sequence Evolution, Structural Similarity, Functional Diversity, and Application Prospects of Glucosinolate Sulfatases", "abstract": "Brassica plants have glucosinolate (GLs)-myrosinase defense mechanisms to deter herbivores.

Finally, we discussed the potential applications of PxGSSs-targeted pest control technologies driven by artificial intelligence, including CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene drive, transgenic plant-mediated RNAi, small-molecule inhibitors, and peptide inhibitors. These technologies have the potential to overcome current management challenges and promote the development and field application of PxGSSs-targeted pest control.", "intro": "IntroductionThe interaction between plants and insects has persisted for more than 350 million years. In response to pest attacks, plants have developed induced secondary metabolites as a defense mechanism. However, specialized herbivorous insects have evolved unique enzymes to adapt to the host plant's defensive chemicals, ensuring their survival and success.Glucosinolates (GLs) are sulfur- and nitrogen-containing secondary metabolites of the Brassicaceae family. The GLs are the dominant components of the binary defense system and are termed the \"mustard oil bomb\" in cruciferous plants. To date, scientists have successfully isolated and identified over 130 different types of GLs. According to their core chemical structure, each monomeric unit of GLs comprises a sulfonated oxime moiety, a beta-thioglucose residue, and a side chain containing various amino acids (also known as the R group). Based on the different R groups, GLs are classified into indolic (derived from Trp), benzenic (derived from Phe and Tyr), and aliphatic (derived from Met, Ala, and Val) types. Like the other binary defense systems, myrosinase, an enzyme that pertains to the beta-thioglucosidase family (EC 3.2.1.147), is usually stored in special myrosinase cells. GLs are produced and stored separately from endogenous myrosinase in the normal or typical plant developmental stage. However, upon tissue damage caused by insect feeding, GLs are activated by myrosinase, which exhibits insecticidal properties. Subsequently, various GLs-derived poisonous products were produced in plants under different physiological conditions as defense mechanisms against herbivores. In addition, isothiocyanates, the defensive toxic compounds, prevent herbivores and insects by reacting with intracellular nucleophiles via their electrophilic -N=C=S groups as they diffuse across cell membranes.A cruciferous leaf cell allocated more than 15% of its energy toward the production of GLs as a cost of defense. However, the invertebrates evolved a class of enzymes that detoxify host plants' GLs during long-term interaction. Glucosinolate sulfatases (GSSs) are well-known cases. Initially, one GSS enzyme was discovered in the snail Helix pomatia. The first functional insect GSSs were identified in P. xylostella. Further research subsequently revealed the identification of additional GSS genes in diverse insect species, including Bemisia tabaci, Schistocerca gregaria, and Psylliodes chrysocephala.- GSSs pertain to the sulfatases (Sulfs) family. They catalyze the hydrolysis of the ester bond (S-O) in GLs, forming deGLs, which are unable to be activated by plant myrosinase to form toxic derivatives. Despite the limited availability of genomic information during that period, a PxGSS sequence from P. xylostella was successfully cloned, and the corresponding protein sequence was identified via mass spectrometric analysis. Subsequent advancements in genome information have resulted in the discovery and characterization of three novel PxGSS genes.- The enzymes encoded by corresponding genes exhibit functional diversity. Through the utilization of advanced integrative multi-omics analysis, substrate-enzyme kinetics, and molecular biological techniques, numerous studies have revealed that three PxGSSs are significantly involved in herbivore-plant, and plant-herbivore-natural enemy interaction (tritrophic interaction). These PxGSSs play a crucial role in modulating host finding, feeding stimulation, and oviposition behavior that ultimately impact on population dynamics of P. xylostella. However, there have been no reports to date regarding the transcriptional and signaling regulation mechanisms or pathways of the PxGSSs, particularly, the identification of transcription factors.Plant-herbivore interactions play a crucial role in regulating insect population dynamics under the challenges imposed by plant defense mechanisms. This coevolutionary dynamics lead to the evolution of diverse adaptations and counteradaptations that shape the diversity of herbivores and plants. However, a literature gap still exists in analyzing and compiling advancements in classical and modern approaches to understanding P. xylostella-plant interaction, which is crucial for developing effective control strategies. Recent studies have demonstrated that irosustat, a steroid sulfatase inhibitor, can effectively inhibit the biological activity of PxGSSs biological activity. This inhibition results in the toxic accumulation of isothiocyanates in larvae, exerting detrimental effects on feeding, reproduction, survival, and growth. It provides a novel and promising control target to replace conventional approaches for managing P. xylostella and overcoming resistance to pesticides.- Hence, a comprehensive review of the current research and technical strategies on PxGSSs is necessary to understand better their critical role in controlling P. xylostella. The result of such an effort can provide better direction for research and management to reduce the annual management cost of $4-5 billion caused by P. xylostella. In addition, it will also provide novel control to manage B. tabaci, which is a vector of various plant diseases and pathogens.Sequence Characteristics and Evolution of PxGSS GenesNomenclature and Specificities of Sulfatase and PxGSSsSulfatases (Sulfs, EC 3.1.5.6) are widely distributed in all domains of life. They demonstrate the remarkable ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of a wide array of alkyl sulfate ester substrates, as well as both synthetic and naturally occurring aryl sulfates. According to the biochemical properties, sulfs have been classified into three types. The type I family is the most prevalent group exclusively found in eukaryotes. It is characterized by a key catalytic residue, formylglycine (FGly; also known as 3-oxo-l-alanine). Type I Sulfs are involved in the hydrolysis of sulfate ester bonds and play a crucial role in the metabolism of sulfated molecules such as proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans. These molecules are important for various biological functions, including cell signaling, development, and tissue homeostasis. Within the Type I family, a diverse range of sulfatases exhibit substrate specificity for different sulfated compounds. Type II Sulfs are a nonheme iron-dependent dioxygenase. They also hydrolyze sulfate ester bonds but require nonheme iron cofactors. These Sulfs utilize molecular oxygen as a cosubstrate in their catalytic reactions. Type II Sulfs are involved in sulfate metabolism and have been identified in various organisms. They contribute to the regulation of sulfate levels and the recycling of sulfated compounds within cellular processes. Type III Sulfs exhibit a distinctive protein folding pattern resembling that of metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes. They are characterized by their ability to bind two zinc ions as cofactors, which is essential for their enzymatic activity. These Sulfs hydrolyze sulfate ester bonds, liberating sulfate groups from substrates. Type III Sulfs possess unique structural and functional properties attributed to their interaction with zinc ions. These interactions stabilize the protein structure and facilitate catalysis. Through zinc ion binding, Type III Sulfs cleave sulfate ester bonds, releasing sulfate groups from diverse substrates. On the contrary, SulfAtlas () is a database that classifies sulfatases into four families (S1-S4) based on sequence-based classification. Nonetheless, according to the data from the Nomenclature Committee of the International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology (), Sulfs can also be divided into 21 categories based on their specificity for different types of ester bonds (EC3.1.6.1 to EC3.1.6.22, in which EC3.1.6.5 was deleted in 1964).Early studies found that most Sulfs in prokaryotes and eukaryotes can hydrolyze small aromatic molecules. Hence, the corresponding Sulfs were referred to as arylsulfatases. Subsequently, numerous studies revealed that the hydrolysis substrates of Sulfs are extensive, and the nomenclature principle is mainly based on the specificity of natural substrates. Despite this, several natural substrates of Sulfs remain unknown. Correspondingly, confusion exists in naming Sulfs due to different nomenclature principles. For instance, steryl sulfatase and N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase in EC3.1.6.2 and EC3.1.6.12 were also named arylsulfatase C (Sulf C) and arylsulfatase B (Sulf B), respectively.An insect GSS is a class of Sulf capable of hydrolyzing specific GLs. Besides P. xylostella, known insects with functional GSS enzymes include desert locust S. gregaria, whitefly B. tabaci, and flea beetle P. chrysocephala.- The gold standard to identify functional GSS is to detect the ability to hydrolyze glucosinolates of Sulf protein through eukaryotic expression. However, the specific number of genes encoding insect functional GSSs has only been identified in B. tabaci and P. chrysocephala. Insect GSSs belong to type I Sulfs because they contain the critical catalytic residue of FGly. Meanwhile, insect GSSs also hydrolyze small aromatic molecules, which are the substrates of Sulfs. Based on the decoded genomic data, 12 Sulf genes were found in P. xylostella, distributed over seven different scaffolds. The latest study used eukaryotic expressing proteins generated in the Sf9 insect cell line and reported that P. xylostella contains three functional PxGSSs (PxGSS1-3). On the contrary, for the 17 Sulf genes in humans, no function related to GLs hydrolysis and its corresponding genes have been identified yet. In summary, the findings from these studies strongly indicate that strategic targeting of PxGSSs represents a promising and reliable strategy for managing P. xylostella populations. Notably, these studies also demonstrate the absence of any observable toxicity to humans or mammals, underscoring the safety and efficacy of this approach.Characterization of PxGSSs Gene and Protein SequencesThe genome of P. xylostella contains information about the gene sequence and coding sequence (CDS) of three PxGSS genes. These genes were identified and confirmed through bioinformatic analysis. The PCR amplification showed that PxGSS1 and PxGSS2 are both 1644 bp long, while PxGSS3 is three bp longer than the former two. These three genes contain seven exons. The sequence similarity of CDS of PxGSS2 and PxGSS3 compared to PxGSS1 was 94.9% and 70.0%, respectively. To date, no alternative splicing event has been reported in the three PxGSS genes. Based on the deduced amino acid data, the length of PxGSS1 and PxGSS2 is 547 amino acids (aa), while PxGSS3 is one aa longer. In comparison with PxGSS1, PxGSS2, and PxGSS3 showed 95.80 and 63.3% similarity in the protein sequence (Figure 1A). The domain structure of PxGSS in the protein sequence was tentatively divided into three parts based on the available data. All three genes were predicted to contain a signal peptide domain (at positions 1-19 aa) and an N-acetylgalactosamine-4-sulfatase or an alkaline phosphatase (NA4S/ALP) domain. Alkaline phosphatase is a nonspecific phosphomonoesterase. It exhibits optimum efficiency in alkaline environments, producing inorganic phosphate through catalytic hydrolysis of phosphate seroyl intermediates. Furthermore, these three PxGSSs have signal peptide sequences but lack a transmembrane structure (prediction software of transmembrane structure; ; accessed on January 2023) (Figure 1A). The N-terminal signal peptide can direct the newly produced protein to specific cell regions and facilitate transmembrane transport. Hence, variations in the signal peptide sequences could potentially influence the secretion of GSS1-3 proteins and their specific subcellular localization.Evolutionary Analysis of PxGSSs and Insect GSS GenesThe genome of P. xylostella contains three PxGSSs and adjacent Sulf D and Sulf B genes in the same scaffold (Figure 1B). However, the directions of transcription of the three PxGSSs are opposite those of the two adjacent genes. Functional and evolutionary analysis of PxGSSs genes revealed that the three genes had undergone two rounds of gene duplication. Accordingly, PxGSS1/2 was the most recent common ancestor gene of PxGSS1 and PxGSS2. Initially, PxGSS3 and PxGSS1/2 underwent divergence through positive selection. Subsequently, PxGSS1 and PxGSS2 were subjected to purification and positive selection to form the final state of the three PxGSSs genes. A significant revelation emerged through a comprehensive collinear analysis conducted in conjunction with other lepidopteran genomes and complemented by phylogenetic trees. This revelation pointed to the Sulf C gene as the putative common ancestor gene for the three identified PxGSS genes. There were two homologous genes, Sulf C1 and Sulf C2, in Bombyx mori; however, in vitro experiments showed that they lack the function of hydrolyzing GLs. Therefore, it is possible that the shared ancestor gene Sulf C in P. xylostella may also lack the ability to metabolize GLs. Nevertheless, the duplicated daughter genes (PxGSS3 and PxGSS1/2) evolved distinct functions under positive selection. This differs from known positive selection-driven models, such as neofunctionalization (NF) and escapes from adaptive conflict (EAC). Furthermore, a notable rate of amino acid substitution, indicative of an adaptive signal, was observed in the duplicated daughter genes. This observation led to the proposal of a novel functional convergence model called concerted neofunctionalization (CN), which aims to elucidate the early duplication mechanism of PxGSS3 and PxGSS1/2. Meanwhile, the NF pattern was more appropriate for explaining the later differentiation of PxGSS1 and PxGSS2 (Figure 1C).The GSSs underwent independent evolution among diverse insect species. Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the three PxGSSs genes were found to be independently clustered away from the other insect GSS genes. This analysis also revealed that PxGSS1 shared 30-34% sequence similarity with the functionally identified GSS genes (PcGSSs) in the flea beetle P. chrysocephala. Resultantly, a species-specific evolutionary lineage of PxGSS emerged.Protein Formylation and Modification Mechanism of PxGSSsFormylation is a special modification event of Sulfs in which cysteine/serine residues are converted into formylglycine residues (FGly), which provides hydrolysis activity of sulfatases. Two types of enzymes are responsible for forming FGly, including the sulfatase modification factor (Sumf; EC 1.8.3.7; also known as formylglycine producing enzyme) and the protein AtsB in microorganisms. Sumf is responsible for converting cysteine residues into FGly, while AtsB is involved in converting serine residues. In P. xylostella, two PxSumf1s proteins are responsible for the formylation modifications of PxGSSs.Structural and Functional Comparison of Human and P. xylostella Sumf1sThe human, Homo sapiens, retains the enzyme Sumf1 (HsSumf1) within the endoplasmic reticulum, releasing it upon overexpression of the HsSumf1 protein. HsSumf1 contains N-glycan that facilitates its binding to the mannose receptor. Structurally, HsSumf1 is a calcium-binding protein (374 aa) that contains a protease resistance domain at the N-terminal (residues 86-168). N-terminal residues 34-72 were also involved in HsSumf1 activity, and truncation resulted in inactivation. The C-terminal domain (residues 178-374) contains substrate binding sites and is stabilized by three pairs of disulfide bonds, results in a pincer-like shape. In addition, intramolecular or intermolecular disulfide bonds promote the formation of homomeric dimers. HsSumf2 (also known as pFGE) has evolved independently in H. sapiens since this gene has lost its original function and is now believed to serve as a chaperone for unfolded sulfatases or mediate their interaction with HsSumf1.In comparison to insects, various insect species have single Sumf1 and Sumf2 genes, while P. xylostella lacks a Sumf2 gene. However, the genome of P. xylostella contains two Sumf1 genes (PxSumf1a and PxSumf1b). Phylogenetic tree analysis of protein sequences indicated that the two PxSumf1s are highly species-specific and have modest homology with HsSumf1 (~30%). In contrast, the two identified PxSumf1 genes exhibit a significant degree of similarity, with a partial amino acid homology of 68%. Notably, three different amino acids were found in the predicted FGly-generating domain within the two PxSumf1s. PxSumf1a and PxSumf1b share a highly identical sequence consisting of 40 amino acids (although four are different). Furthermore, our previous study demonstrated the interaction of PxSumf1a or PxSumf1b with PxGSS1 in a yeast two-hybrid experiment. This finding is reminiscent of the interaction observed in humans, where HsSumf2 serves as a regulatory factor for HsSumf1. It is worth mentioning that while no model insect has been studied regarding this gene, the use of humans as a model provides valuable insights into the structural and functional comparison of Sumf1s.Moreover, the lack of PxSumf1a or PxSumf1b reduces the ability of the endogenous PxGSSs to compete with the plant myrosinase, leading to a high fitness cost when the clustered regularly interspersed palindromic repeats (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9)-mediated mutated larvae feed on the host plant.Conserved Formylation Mechanism in Human and P. xylostellaThe formation of FGly from cysteine residues involves a multistep redox process, including the transformation of intermolecular and intramolecular disulfide bonds. The crystallographic analysis of HsSumf1 revealed its monomeric nature, characterized by a relatively low content of secondary structure elements. Particularly, the protein exhibited only 20% beta-structure and 13% alpha-structure. The main structure composition feature includes two Ca2+ions, one Asn141 with N-glycosylated, two cis-peptide bonds at Pro115 and Pro266, and three disulfide bonds. The surface of HsSumf1 has an oval groove for substrate binding (length x depth x width = 20 x 10 x 12 A). Both ends are bound by Cys336/Cys341 and Pro182, respectively. Six independent structures from six independent/separate crystals crystallized under different redox conditions confirmed the formation of disulfide bonds between Cys336 and Cys341. The experimental results demonstrate that Cys336 is more sensitive to oxidation than Cys341, leading to the oxidation of Cys336 to cysteine sulfoxide. In this case, disulfide bonds can form between Cys336 and Cys341 due to their close proximity.The formylation reaction is basic and efficient because the whole process only requires reducing agents and molecular oxygen rather than cofactors or metal ions. However, the latest study reveals the specific role played by copper in the Sumf1-catalyzed oxidation reaction. Based on the computational data of hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM), Cu(II)-OOH, covering a hydrogen atom abstraction from the substrate and environmental O2, continues to form Cu(I)-alkylperoxo intermediate, followed by an O-O bond cleavage leading to a FGly. Although no crystal structures of PxSumf1s bound to peptide substrates have been solved, PxSumf1s showed high structural similarity with HsSumf1, leaving the ligand-root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of PxSumf1a or PxSumf1b between HsSumf1 at 0.163 and 0.186, respectively (Figure 2A). The comparison of HsSumf1, PxSumf1a, and PxSumf1b reveals three distinct areas, with significant differences occurring in areas A1 and A3 and fewer in the catalytic pocket in area A2 (Figure 2A).Through cocrystallization of HsSumf1 and the substrate peptides CTPSR or LCTPSRA, it was determined that the binding of the substrate is attributed to Cys341 in A2 and the substrate oxidation to Cys336 (Figure 2B). Particularly, the intrinsic disulfide bond in HsSumf1 was disrupted. A new intermolecular disulfide bond was constructed between Cys341 and Cys of the substrate in a thiol-disulfide exchange manner. Based on the high similarity in predicted structures between HsSumf1 and two PxSumf1s, the corresponding critical amino acid residues were found in PxSumf1s as well (Table 1). We speculate that two PxSumf1s with a pair of disulfide bonds use the same methods to generate peroxysulfenic acid at Cys305 (for PxSumf1a) and Cys317 (for PxSumf1b) in an O2 environment. The formation of two intermediate products (P1 and P2) facilitates the compilation of the formylation of PxGSSs by releasing one H2O atom (Figure 2C and D).Substrate Diversity and Action Mechanism of PxGSSsSubstrate Diversity and Structural Properties of Three PxGSSsThe enzyme PxGSS was first reported in 2002. It is capable of extensive hydrolysis of various GLs in insects, with high in vivo desulfurization efficiency (Km = 1.61-2.33 mM). Based on their calculations, one larva can desulfate the GLs present in 100 mg of fresh leaves within 30 min. PxGSSs hydrolyze GLs substrates and release sulfate to form deGLs, which are unable to be activated by myrosinase. Moreover, the released sulfate further strongly inhibits myrosinase. The substrate diversity of three duplicate PxGSSs was found in P. xylostella (Figure 3A); PxGSS1 accepted all GLs as substrates in vitro, except for 1MOI3M, a Trp-GL that is usually found in high concentrations in plant roots. PxGSS2 only accepts Met-derived GLs, except for Phe- and Trp-derived GLs. In contrast, PxGSS3 was able to desulfurize Phe-, Trp-, and Val-GLs, but not Met-GLs. Moreover, the substrates preferred by GSSs of other insect species also differ. Specifically, in the P. chrysocephala, the PcGSS1 and PcGSS2 protein showed moderate hydrolysis ability for sinalbin and indol-3-ylmethyl GL, whereas, PcGSS3, PcGSS4, and PcGSS5 showed insignificant levels of hydrolysis ability for several GLs. There is evidence that Met-GL induces PxGSS1 and PxGSS2 expression, while Trp-GL induces PxGSS3. However, the total protein amount of PxGSS1/2 (no individual antibody is available due to the high similarity) was independent of major GLs contents, while PxGSS3 was inducible by Trp-GL in A. thaliana plants. Hence, a mixed enzymatic model was proposed because P. xylostella possesses two constitutive (PxGSS1/2) and one inducible (PxGSS3) enzyme.The homology modeling revealed that the three PxGSSs share similar overall structural properties and display a C-shaped pocket in the lateral view (Figures 3B and C). A higher level of protein similarity exists between PxGSS1 and PxGSS2 compared to PxGSS1 and PxGSS3. Correspondingly, the RMSD value for the structural similarity of PxGSS1 and PxGSS2 (0.118 A) is lower than that for PxGSS1 and PxGSS3 (0.204 A), indicating a higher level of structural similarity between PxGSS1 and PxGSS2 (Figure 3B and C). These data imply that the opening size of the C-shape pocket might be related to substrate specificity. However, the natural cocrystal of GL and a specific PxGSS needs to be further explored.Comparing the Mode of Actions of Human Sulfatases and P. xylostella GSSsHuman arylsulfatases contain a critical catalytic residue, FGly, which exerts its function through nucleophilic aldehyde hydrate formation. This enzymatic process initiates by triggering the sulfate ester hydrolysis reaction through a nucleophilic attack targeting the sulfur atom within the substrate. Enzymatic experiments on mutants of human arylsulfatase A and arylsulfatase B, which contain a serine residue instead of Fgly, and a cocrystal structure of a FGly-alanine HARSA mutant with the substrate proved that the hydrolysis of sulfate occurs through the transesterification-elimination mechanism. The process of FGly formation involves a multistep redox reaction, wherein the hydrated group of formylglycine initiates a nucleophilic attack on the substrate's sulfur. This leads to the generation of covalent FGly-sulfate intermediates and the release of conjugated alcohols. Finally, SO42- is eliminated, and FGly is regenerated. This represents a reversible transformation between FGly and its diol (FGly diol) form, which is formed by combining the aldehyde group of FGly with a water molecule. According to the chemical properties of the aldehyde group and the electrophilicity of FGly, the formation of FGly diol by the combination of the aldehyde group of FGly with a water molecule was confirmed based on structural analyses of human HARSA, HARSB, and HARSC.-Mutation of PxSumf1a or PxSumf1b by CRISPR/Cas9 resulted in larvae losing GL competing activity with myrosinase, suggesting that the active site of PxGSS is related to FGly. The structural similarities between PARS (a Sulf from Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and PxGSS1 suggest that PxGSSs may bind to the substrate GL and activate FGly glycol through an aspartic acid residue (Asp; Figure 4A and B). This is supported by the fact that all three PxGSSs contain an Asp residue in the same position (Asp281, Asp281, and Asp282, respectively) as residue 317 in PARS (Table 2). Based on the known decoded reaction, a postulation arises that a hydroxyl group acts as a nucleophile to attack the sulfur atom of the GL substrate in P. xylostella. This leads to the release of alcohol as a byproduct, and an enzyme intermediate is formed. The enzyme intermediate can be subsequently desulfurized through two possible pathways: sulfur hydrolysis (SN2) or deprotonation of the remaining FGly glycol hydroxyl group by an overconservative histidine (Figure 4C and D). Furthermore, three PxGSSs and PARS possessed proline (Pro) and histidine (His) residues, respectively (Table 2). The His residue at position 211 is considered to act as a proton source. However, the Pro residue at the same position is uncharged and requires further investigation to understand its role better.Expression Pattern and Distribution of PxGSSsSpatiotemporal Expression Pattern of Three PxGSSsThree PxGSSs exhibited distinct spatiotemporal patterns in transcription and translation levels (Figure 5). Based on qRT-PCR analysis, the transcripts of PxGSS1 and PxGSS2 genes exhibited significantly higher expression levels in larvae while not being expressed in eggs and adults. Further dissection of the larvae revealed that PxGSS1 was significantly expressed in salivary glands, with levels about 50 times greater than those of PxGSS2. In addition, both transcripts were highly expressed in the gut, while they were insignificantly found in Malpighian tubules and not detected in silk glands. Simultaneously, the levels of gene expression in the foregut, midgut, and hindgut were significantly high and comparable. Although the expression characteristics of PxGSS3 have not been extensively analyzed, available data on tissue-specific expression suggest that PxGSS3 is relatively highly expressed in the midgut. However, its expression level was significantly lower compared to PxGSS1 and PxGSS2.According to a WB analysis using the PxGSS1/2 antibody, both proteins were highly expressed in larvae of the 3rd- and 4th-instars, while not in eggs or adults. The protein levels in the tissues were consistent with the transcriptional patterns of PxGSS1 and PxGSS2. Nevertheless, it is challenging to quantify the content of PxGSS1 and PxGSS2 in vivo due to the lack of specific antibodies. Despite the difficulty in measuring the contents of PxGSS1 and PxGSS2 due to their high similarity, the in vivo content ratio of PxGSS1 to PxGSS2 was approximately 3:1, as determined by WB assays on PxGSS1-/- or PxGSS2-/- mutant larvae. Intriguingly, PxGSS1 was also detected on damaged plant leaves attacked by larvae. By combining transcript and protein profiling, it was found that PxGSS1 is the main component in oral secretions, while PxGSS2 is barely released. However, the protein expression level of PxGSS3 has not been studied yet.In Vitro and In Vivo Distribution Characteristics of PxGSSsSulfs are soluble and localized in various cellular compartments in all known invertebrates, lower eukaryotes, and bacteria. These compartments include the cytoplasm, the membrane, and the extracellular regions. In higher eukaryotes, the lysosomes and extracellular Sulfs are distributed in soluble and membrane-resident forms, located within the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Following translation, human sulfatases localize within the endoplasmic reticulum, with divergent destinations; while a portion remains within the endoplasmic reticulum, others are directed toward the lysosome, the Golgi apparatus or the cell membrane. The sulfation level of cell-surface heparin sulfate, which plays a vital role in cell signaling and embryonic development, is regulated by secreted sulfatases (Sulf1 and Sulf2). Consequently, these sulfatases modulate signaling events that are crucial for these processes.In P. xylostella, a plentiful expression of PxGSS1 and PxGSS2 was detected in the gut contents of P. xylostella larvae. Noteworthy, the oral/salivary secretory protein contains a significant amount of PxGSS1 protein, while the presence of PxGSS2 and PxGSS3 is negligible. Likewise, the corresponding enzyme activity of PxGSS1/2 can be detected in the feces. These results strongly suggest that three PxGSSs are soluble and secreted, implying that PxGSS1 is present in two different scenarios: in vivo in the gut and in vitro in saliva and feces.Functional Diversity of PxGSSsThe Roles of PxGSSs in Multispecies InteractionsThe Roles of PxGSSs in the P. xylostella-Host Plant InteractionLong-term evolution has led to the development of constitutive and induced defenses, enabling plants to protect themselves from herbivore attacks. The induced strategy can produce more than 500,000 secondary metabolites, including well-known compounds such as GLs, cyanogenic glycosides, alkaloids, nicotine, and phenolics. These compounds play a critical role in deterring insects.- Indeed, approximately40 types of GLs exhibit diverse bioactivity, such as anticancer, antidiabetic, antioxidant, and immune regulation. The insecticidal activity of 4MSOB-GL, which represents 75% of the total aliphatic GLs content in A. thaliana Col-0 ecotype leaves, has been fully characterized. However, when 4MSOB-GL was directly used to feed P. xylostella, 81% were metabolized to nontoxic 4MSOB-deGL in feces collections. Further study revealed that PxGSSs are responsible for this detoxification of 4MSOB-GL. Silencing PxGSS1 through plant-mediated RNAi resulted in a 90% increase in the level of 4MSOB-GL and a 10-fold increase in the concentrations of 4MSOB-ITC in larvae compared to the control group. In myb28myb29 plants lacking 4MSOB-GL, the introduction of 4MSOB-ITC through infusion led to substantial alterations in the developmental outcomes of the larvae. Particularly, there was a significant 50% decrease in larval weight, a 3-fold increase in pupal mortality, and a notable decline of over 45% in the number of eggs laid compared to larvae that consumed plants infiltrated with a solvent. Furthermore, the survival rates of third-instar larvae from CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutant strains were assessed after they were transferred to A. thaliana plants (Col-0 ecotype). The results showed that the survival rates of larvae in PxGSS1-/-, PxGSS2-/-, and PxGSS1&2-/- mutant strains were 70%, 60%, and 30%, respectively. These results demonstrate that endogenous PxGSSs blocked the systemic production of toxic ITCs in P. xylostella larvae to prevent GL-derived plant defenses (Figure 6A).The function of PxGSS1 is not limited to the gut of the host insect but extends to the damaged leaves of the host plant, revealing an interesting aspect of its role. P. xylostella larvae feeding on A. thaliana were found to release a significant amount of PxGSS1 through oral secretions deposited onto leaf wounds. The analysis of 4MSOB-deGL revealed that only WT larvae feeding on A. thaliana exhibited significantly higher concentrations of 4MSOB-deGL compared to other treatments, including PxGSS1&2-/- larvae feeding or physical damage. To investigate the release of 4MSOB-deGL from the gut of WT larvae onto damaged leaves, a combination of a plant and artificial diet as a feed resource with altered nutritional consequences was used. Collectively, the considerable accumulation of 4MSOB-deGL in leaves is not due to regurgitation from the larvae's gut but instead results from hydrolysis catalyzed by the secreted PxGSS1 enzyme. This process elucidates the mechanism of PxGSS1-mediated predetoxification.The Roles of PxGSSs in the Tritrophic InteractionExperimental models were established to determine the roles of PxGSSs in the interactions among plants, insects, and predators. The model covered transgenic A. thaliana expressing dsRNA of PxGSS1, P. xylostella, and herbivorous predators. In model 1, the predator was the lacewing Chrysoperla carnea, while in model 2, it was the endoparasitoid Diadegma semiclausum. The metabolism of GLs in P. xylostella was inhibited in both models using plant-mediated RNAi. Subsequently, an investigation was conducted to assess the developmental, metabolic, and reproductive ramifications associated with ingestion of larvae with silenced PxGSSs. In P. xylostella larvae, suppression of PxGSSs expression causes severe fitness costs due to the accumulation of ITCs in the gut and hemolymph. Nevertheless, there was a slight difference in the effects of elevated ITCs passed to C. carnea and D. semiclausum preying on PxGSSs-silenced P. xylostella larvae. In model 1, when C. carnea larvae were fed with PxGSSs-silenced P. xylostella larvae that exhibited elevated levels of 4MSOB-ITC, only a minor delay in the larval growth was observed. In contrast, there was no significant impact on pupal or adult performance. In model 2, feeding D. semiclausum larvae with PxGSSs-silenced P. xylostella larvae resulted in delayed development and lower adult emergence success. However, higher adult weights and lipid contents were observed.Despite being exposed to elevated ITC levels, predators activated a specific metabolic pathway for their metabolism. In model 1, a relatively high amount of the 4MSOB-ITC derivative, the mercapturic acid conjugate of 4MSOB-ITC-N-acetylcysteine, was detected in various tissues and feces of C. carnea larvae or adults. Similarly, in model 2, 4MSOB-ITC mercapturic acid conjugates (4MSOB-ITC-glutathione, 4MSOB-ITC-cysteinylglycine, and 4MSOB-ITC-cysteine) were detected in D. semiclausum larvae after feeding on PxGSSs-silenced P. xylostella larvae. In tritrophic interactions, the role of PxGSSs is regarded as the primary line of defense against herbivore predators. In contrast, a mercapturic acid pathway that metabolizes the remaining 4MSOB-ITC is considered a secondary and ancillary defense mechanism. Collectively, these defense mechanisms play a crucial role in regulating predator-prey interactions in the ecosystem (Figure 6B).Function of PxGSS2 in Development of P. xylostellaHsSulf1 and HsSulf2, besides their direct participation in substrate hydrolysis associated with cellular degradation, pathogenesis, and hormone regulation, also play pivotal roles in cell development. They modulate interactions between negatively charged linear sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) and various signaling molecules, including Wingless/Int (Wnt), Sonic Hedgehog, fibroblast growth factors, and bone morphogenetic proteins.The PxGSS2 has been experimentally confirmed to contribute to the development of P. xylostella. Under a non-GL-adding artificial diet, CRISPR/Cas9-mediated deficiency in PxGSS2 significantly reduced egg hatching and larval survival rates. In contrast, no significant reductions in these parameters were observed in a single mutant strain of PxGSS1-/- when compared with the WT strains. In the known model involving Sulf and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (GAGs), extracellular Wnt signaling molecules exhibit a high affinity for heparan sulfate proteoglycans in the extracellular matrix. This interaction leads to the appropriate differentiation of cells and embryonic patterning.- Sulf1s in different species can reduce the affinity between heparan sulfate and Wnt by hydrolyzing the sulfate group of heparan sulfate. Subsequently, it promotes the binding of Wnt and its corresponding Frizzled receptor to transmit the signal to the cell.- Nonetheless, in the model organism D. melanogaster, a negative regulation within the Wnt signaling pathway was observed. It has been reported that Sulf1 can hydrolyze 2-O-sulfo-iduronic acid-N-sulfoglucosamine-6-O-sulfate, a type of heparan sulfate. Based on the transcriptome comparison of WT, PxGSS1-/-, and PxGSS2-/- larvae, more downregulated genes in the Wnt signal pathway were found in PxGSS2-/- vs WT in comparison to PxGSS1-/- vs WT. The gene expression levels of six candidate genes in the Wnt signal pathway among WT, PxGSS1-/-, and PxGSS2-/- were subsequently validated by qRT-PCR. Most of the six candidate genes in the PxGSS2-/- group were downregulated compared to the WT group, while no significant difference was observed in the PxGSS1-/- group. However, further verification of the specific mechanism among the PxGSS2 protein, Wnt signaling, and specific proteoglycans is still necessary.The Role of PxGSSs in Cry1Ac ResistanceThe Cry1Ac toxin produced by Bacillus thuringiensis is a potent insecticide. It was first developed for commercial purposes in 1938.- This toxin exerts its effect through a series of steps, including activation of the protoxin, interaction with toxin receptors, oligomerization, and membrane insertion (Figure 7A).- Despite its high lethality against P. xylostella, this pest has developed resistance to Cry1Ac toxin, making it the first agricultural pest in the field to resist the biological pesticide produced by B. thuringiensis. Numerous toxin receptors have been identified in Lepidopterans, including cadherin-like (CAD), ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters, aminopeptidase-N (APN), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP).- However, the mechanisms underlying Cry1Ac resistance in P. xylostella are complex and involve various factors. These include differences in toxin activation and the involvement of specific receptors such as PxAPN1, PxAPN3a, PxABCC2, and PxABCC3. Moreover, recent studies have also demonstrated that the MAPK signaling cascade, modulated by insect hormones such as juvenile hormone and 20-hydroxyecdysone, is critical in regulating the expression of specific toxin receptors. This precise regulation controls the number and density of diverse receptors such as PxALP, PxAPNs, and PxABCCs to cope with the insecticidal action of Cry1Ac toxin effectively.Meanwhile, a second resistance mechanism, termed \"toxin neutralization\", was proposed early. Insects contain numerous intestinal proteins that have the potential to bind Cry1A-type toxins. These proteins reduce the possibility of toxic proteins binding with corresponding receptors, thus neutralizing or weakening the toxicity of the toxin. Indeed, the latest study has reported that the immune proteins of Dorsal and POX-C in P. xylostella competitively bind to Cry1Ab1, decreasing the interaction between receptors in brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) and Cry1Ab1. Direct studies on the resistance of P. xylostella to Cry1Ac, a gut protein with a molecular weight of 66 kDa (also known as P66), have revealed the presence of higher levels of P66 in the intestinal contents of the Cry1Ac-resistant strain of P. xylostella. The resistant strain exhibited three times the content and activity of P66 compared to the susceptible strain. Further mass spectrometric and zymographic assays revealed that P66 is a PxGSS protein, but the peptide information was limited to identifying the exact member(s) from the three PxGSSs. Using surface plasmon resonance measurements, the dissociation constant of the purified PxGSS protein (substrate Cry1Ac) was estimated to be 718 nM. Although Cry1Ac and BBMV have preferential binding characteristics (dissociation constant is about 300 nM), the author suggested that PxGSSs with a high protein content (7.3% of total protein) are more likely to encounter with Cry1Ac in their natural physiological environment. In addition, the glycosylation (O type glycosylation) of PxGSS protein can be recognized by the glycosylation recognition structure in Cry1Ac domain III. These studies supported the notion that the plentiful PxGSS protein may interact with Cry1Ac to reduce the interaction of toxic receptors, thereby neutralizing its toxicity (Figure 7B).Application Prospects for P. xylostella by Targeting the PxGSSs EnzymePxGSS1-Targeted Gene Drive Mediated by CRISPR/Cas9 SystemGene drive refers to a phenomenon in which specific genetic elements are transmitted to offspring at frequencies greater than the typical Mendelian inheritance rate of 50%. This powerful mechanism allows for the rapid spread of the desired genetic traits within a population. In the context of pest control, gene drive can be used to introduce genetically modified individuals that possess traits beneficial for controlling pests. Different from the previous meiotic drive, sex-ratio distortions, and replicative transposition element-mediated gene drive, the utilization of CRISPR/Cas9 technology has significantly expedited the advancement and application of CRISPR/Cas9-activated gene drive. This is primarily due to the precise and efficient genome editing capabilities provided by CRISPR/Cas9. The CRISPR/Cas9-activated gene drive has been successfully applied to Dipteran insects, such as Anopheles stephensi and Anopheles gambiae, demonstrating its high efficiency for pest control.-Recent developments include the successful establishment of multithreaded editing tools in cells. A transgenic insect line has been used to test gene drive efficiency in P. xylostella, confirming the availability of the U6 promoter for transcribing fluorescent/phenotypic marker genes- and potential germline-specific promoters for driving Cas9. However, the feasibility of using U6 Pol III promoters and germline-active Pol II promoters (Pxvasa, PxnanosP, and Pxmeiw68) has been confirmed in the corresponding transgenic lines. The gene drive rate was extremely minimal in hybrid offspring based on various cross-combinations. Although Pxvasa and PxnanosP drove higher rates of Cas9 activity than Pxmeiw68, both promoters also displayed unexpected leaky somatic expression of Cas9 and a low homing rate. To increase the efficiency of the homing reaction, it may be necessary to induce a sufficient amount of Cas9 and synchronize the expressions between sgRNA and Cas9 temporally and spatially.Targeting PxGSS1 as a control gene using gene drive appears to be feasible when the gene drive rate has achieved the anticipated level, as no significant fitness cost was observed in the PxGSS1-/- strain on an artificial diet without GLs. Additionally, the released transgenic insect strains were unable to neutralize the mustard oil bomb in the wild environment, indicating the potential effectiveness of this approach when the gene drive rate reaches the expected level (Figure 8A). Specifically, in the gene drive strategy, the cassette containing sgRNA-PxGSS1, Cas9 and Maleness gene (M) was integrated into the second exon of PxGSS1 in the P. xylostella genome to generate PxGSS1 function-defective insects via homologous recombination. The complex of sgRNA-Cas9 directly caused the site-directed mutation in the PxGSS1 gene in the other chromosome. A homology-directed repair leads to a homozygous mutant during the homing process. A new homing process will occur in wild-type insects when mated with homozygous mutant individuals, and the GLs-myrosinase bomb deterred PxGSSs-defective wild-type larvae in the plants. Meanwhile, the Maleness genes in P. xylostella, such as P-element somatic inhibitor or insulin-like growth factor II mRNA-binding protein, will interfere with doublesex to produce male-specific transcript isoform, leading to male-dominant populations.- The overall design resembles another management approach known as the release of insects carrying a dominant lethal gene (RIDL). In this strategy, transgenic insects can survive solely on a diet supplemented with an antidote. However, without an antidote, they perish due to the presence of the lethal gene when released into the wild.The application of gene drive strategies also poses challenges, such as unintended ecological consequences. Introducing genetically modified organisms into ecosystems may have unexpected impacts on the environment and nontarget species. Notably, evaluations and surveillance of gene-drive-mediated pest control have precedents. The self-limitation strategy of female-specific RIDL, governed by the doublesex system in P. xylostella, has been successfully evaluated in netted caged and glasshouse scales. Furthermore, a few thousand transgenic moths per acre were released in the small-scale field (; accessed on May 2023), which provided valuable experience for other releases of transgenic P. xylostella.Transgenic Plant-Mediated RNAiPlant transgenesis mediated by RNAi is based on the principle of generating transgenic plant varieties that efficiently express double-stranded RNA to suppress the expression of specific genes in target pests through the RNAi mechanism. In 2007, the coleopteran insect Diabrotica virgifera virgifera and lepidopteran insect Helicoverpa armigera confirmed that dsRNA expressed by transgenic plants could be transported into the gut of insects by oral delivery, confirming the potential of the transgenic plant-mediated method for pest control. The feeding assay effectively inhibited the expression of vacuolar ATPase (V-ATPase) subunits A-E, and alpha-tubulin in D. virgifera, leading to significant larval mortality and stunting at diverse dsRNA concentrations. Notably, 14 tested dsRNAs demonstrated robust activity, exhibiting LC50 values below 5.2%, demonstrating their significant impact on D. virgifera population. Moreover, the expression of hairpin RNA targeting the cytochrome P450 gene CYP6AE14 in cotton plants effectively suppresses gene expression in the midgut of H. armigera. This downregulation of CYP6AE14 significantly hinders larval growth in the presence of gossypol, a cotton metabolite. In contrast to coleopteran insects, lepidopteran insects exhibited relatively weak responses to RNAi. In order to improve the efficacy of transgenic plants in pest control, it is crucial to focus on the construction of transgenic plants capable of expressing dsRNA and the intrinsic environment of the targeted insects. In the aspect of transgenic plants, the efficiency of plant RNAi was influenced by several factors including the selection of target gene, dsRNA length, expressing vector, and transformation strategy (such as nuclear transformation, plastid transformation, and virus-mediated transient transformation). Meanwhile, the dsRNA molecules were further degraded after feeding by P. xylostella due to the relatively high activities of certain dsRNases. In addition, the high alkalinity, ionic composition, and metabolite variations in the digestive fluids also restrict the effectiveness of plant-mediated RNAi. Although no commercial transgenic plant expressing dsRNA/siRNA is currently available for controlling lepidopteran insects, RNAi technology has emerged as a research hotspot for pest management in P. xylostella. Numerous strategies have been successfully employed, including microbial-mediated, plant-mediated, and nanoparticle-encapsulated dsRNA strategies in P. xylostella.- Notably, in 2019, the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, an institute of plant sciences, received commercial funding from the biopesticide company TechAccel to conduct sprayable pest controls for P. xylostella and other lepidopteran species using RNAi techniques (; accessed on January 2023).Direct evidence has shown that virus-mediated transgenic Arabidopsis plants expressing dsRNA of PxGSS1 can effectively interfere with the target gene after P. xylostella feeding. While successfully interfering with the target gene PxGSS1, it also significantly interfered with the expression of PxGSS2 and PxGSS3 due to highly conserved sequence similarity, which presents a surprising beneficial off-target phenomenon to amplify RNAi effects of PxGSSs. Likewise, this phenomenon also exists in P. chrysocephala. Using regions outside of the gene body in PcGSS1 or PcGSS2 for dsRNA design led to the inhibition of the expressions of PcGSS4 and PcGSS5. Nevertheless, the off-target effect requires less attention since no GSSs exist in the tritrophic level, resulting in the limited possibility of the effect to pass on to the next level. Current evidence suggests that RNAi technology for controlling P. xylostella relies on transgenic Arabidopsis plants with transient expression of virus-mediated dsRNA. However, to evaluate and implement RNAi as a practical strategy for pest control, it is crucial to develop stable transgenic plants with a consistent and durable expression of the target dsRNA. Notably, resistance to RNAi by plant-expressed long double-stranded RNAs has been reported in lepidopteran species, such as H. armigera. Nonetheless, this problem can be overcome by expressing short interfering RNAs. Therefore, integration of long double-stranded RNAs or short interfering RNAs should be considered when the transgenic plant-mediated RNAi strategy was utilized for P. xylostella control (Figure 8B).Small-Molecule Inhibitor of PxGSSs Enzyme ActivityIrosustat is a potent inhibitor that has been shown to effectively inhibit the enzymatic activity of steroid sulfatase. Based on virtual screenings of the three-dimensional structure of PxGSS1 with 23 types of sterol sulfatase inhibitors, irosustat was identified as the most effective inhibitor candidate. In the feeding experiment, the crude enzyme extract of PxGSSs was exposed to 10 mg/L irosustat in the intestine, and the inhibition efficiency was determined using 4MSOB as the detection substrate. The results showed that the inhibition efficiency was 78.97%, and the IC50 concentration was 2.12 mg/L. Simultaneously, desulfurized irosustat has no significant effect on the inhibition of PxGSSs in vivo, indicating that irosustat may compete with the substrate 4MSOB-GL to achieve inhibition of PxGSSs activity. Additionally, irosustat exhibited significant inhibition of damage caused by P. xylostella to plant leaves as well as growth and developmental parameters of P. xylostella upon feeding on host plants. These findings suggest that using small molecules to inhibit PxGSSs activity holds potential for further applications (Figure 8C). Nevertheless, there is still room for optimization of the IC50 value of irosustat derived from sterol sulfatase inhibitors. Therefore, the future direction of further research should focus on modifying the skeleton structure of GLs and optimizing the IC50 values to develop small molecule inhibitors with stronger inhibitory effects and better IC50 values.Peptide Inhibitors of PxGSSs Formylation ActivityPeptides are short chains of amino acids, typically consisting of less than 50 amino acid residues bonded by either eupeptide or isopeptide bonds. Oligopeptides, on the other hand, are shorter chains consisting of fewer than 20 amino acid residues. For plants, peptides likely evolved as a component of the plant's defense response, primarily in response to biotic stress. Subsequently, their roles expanded to encompass various development, morphogenesis, and reproduction aspects. Furthermore, the well-identified insect neuropeptideergic system offers potential targets to control insect vectors.It has been previously shown that residues 65-80 in HsSulf A, which includes the critical Cys at position 69, are essential for the interaction between HsSulf and HsSumf1 under in vitro microsome conditions. Moreover, single or multiple amino acid mutational analyses on peptides-derived from HsSulfs demonstrated that a core motif, pentapeptide CXPSR (X stands for any amino acid), were crucial for the recognition of eukaryotic sulfatases by HsSumf1. Notably, 13-aa (LCTPSRAALLTGR) and 16-aa (PVSLCTPSRAALLTGR) synthetic peptides, comprising the core motif, both significantly inhibited HsSumf1 activity in vitro (90% and 98%, respectively).Although two PxSumf1s were found in P. xylostella, the pocket structures of both PxSumf1s are highly similar to that of HsSumf1 (Figure 2). Based on the in vitro data, the human-derived 13-aa and 16-aa synthetic peptides can be considered inhibitors that impair the formylation of Sulfs. The related work of feeding P. xylostella larvae with various synthetic peptides and testing the inhibition efficiency of PxGSSs is ongoing, as depicted in Figure 8D. Furthermore, expressing short peptides through transgenic host plants or transgenic microorganisms and directly spraying the short peptides are feasible in future applications."}, "36499110": {"doi": "10.3390/ijms232314781", "title": "BocODD1 and BocODD2 Regulate the Biosynthesis of Progoitrin Glucosinolate in Chinese Kale", "abstract": "Progoitrin (2-hydroxy-3-butenyl glucosinolate, PRO) is the main source of bitterness of Brassica plants. Research on the biosynthesis of PRO glucosinolate can aid the understanding of the nutritional value in Brassica plants. In this study, four ODD genes likely involved in PRO biosynthesis were cloned from Chinese kale. These four genes, designated as BocODD1-4, shared 75-82% similarities with the ODD sequence of Arabidopsis. The sequences of these four BocODDs were analyzed, and BocODD1 and BocODD2 were chosen for further study. The gene BocODD1,2 showed the highest expression levels in the roots, followed by the leaves, flowers, and stems, which is in accordance with the trend of the PRO content in the same tissues. Both the expression levels of BocODD1,2 and the content of PRO were significantly induced by high- and low-temperature treatments. The function of BocODDs involved in PRO biosynthesis was identified. Compared with the wild type, the content of PRO was increased twofold in the over-expressing BocODD1 or BocODD2 plants. Meanwhile, the content of PRO was decreased in the BocODD1 or BocODD2 RNAi lines more than twofold compared to the wildtype plants. These results suggested that BocODD1 and BocODD2 may play important roles in the biosynthesis of PRO glucosinolate in Chinese kale.", "intro": "1. IntroductionGlucosinolates (GSLs) are a group of important secondary metabolites that are mainly found in the Brassicaceae family. These secondary metabolites can protect plants from insects and some pathogen infections. The degradation products of some GSLs, such as glucoraphanin (RAA), have strong anticarcinogenic activity. However, another glucosinolate, PRO, is the main source of bitterness of Brassica plants, and the hydrolyzed production of PRO may cause goiters in mammals. For these reasons, the accumulation of PRO seriously affects the nutritional value of Brassica vegetables.Glucosinolate consists of a beta-D-thioglucosyl, a sulfonate, and a branched R group. The glucosinolates are classified into three types, namely, aliphatic, aromatic, and indole GSLs, depending on the origin of the biosynthetic precursor standard amino acid. The biosynthesis pathway is divided into three steps: the carbon chain elongation of the amino acid, the formation of the basic skeleton, and the modification of the side chain, which results in the chemical diversity of glucosinolates. Multiple QTL sites controlling the chemical structure of the side chain have been identified, including GSL-Elong, GSL-OX, GSL-ALK, and GSL-OH in Arabidopsis. GSL-Elong is involved in the production of glucosinolate with three carbon or four carbon side chains; then, the GSL-Alk enzyme catalyzes the glucoraphanin to gluconapin. Finally, the enzyme regulates the conversion of gluconapin (NAP) to progoitrin by the gene located on the GSL-OH locus (Figure 1A).The GSL-OH locus was finely mapped using several populations of the A. thaliana recombinant inbred line LerxCvi and a gene named 2-ODD (2-oxo acid -dependent dioxygenase, At2g25450) was identified in Arabidopsis. The expression of 2-ODD in A. thaliana is positively correlated with the accumulation of PRO in different genotypes and knocking out the GSL-OH allele inhibits PRO synthesis in Arabidopsis. This study provides a basis for the mechanism involved in regulating the content of PRO glucosinolates through genetic engineering. However, the function of the 2-ODD gene in other cruciferous plants is still unknown.Chinese kale (Brassica olearcea var. chinese Lei), which originated in South China and spread throughout Southeast Asia thereafter, is an important cruciferous vegetable crop in China, especially in South China, where the majority of varieties are grown. Chinese kale is rich in nutritional compounds, including vitamin C, minerals, and glucosinolates, with a long history of cultivation and abundant germplasm resources in China. Notably, the content of glucoraphanin, whose isothiocyanate product can protect against tumorigenesis, is accumulated at a high level in many genotypes of Chinese kale.In our previous study, glucosinolate was extracted and analyzed in more than 70 Chinese kale genotypes, and the data showed that the ratio of PRO/NAP was significantly different in various genotypes (Figure 1B). However, the mechanism of the GSL accumulation with different levels remains unknown. In this study, the PRO and NAP content of several Chinese kale genotypes was analyzed. Four ODD genes were cloned and analyzed from Chinese kale plants. The function of BocODD1 and BocODD2 involved in PRO biosynthesis was analyzed by overexpression and RNA interference technology. The results provide a theoretical reference for the creation of low-PRO germplasm resources by genetic engineering in Chinese kale and other Brassica plants.", "results": "2. Results2.1. Determination of Glucosinolate Content in Chinese KaleFour accessions of Chinese kale were selected from our previous study according to the glucosinolate content, in which the genotypes Shengzhong and Xichangzhong have a much higher ratio of PRO/NAP than Taoshanzhonghua and Benditiezhong (Figure 1). To further verify these results, the content of PRO was determined again, and there were 0.15, 0.16, 0.16, and 0.22 mg g-1 DW PRO and 11.92, 1.43, 7.01, and 4.00 mg g-1 DW NAP in the genotypes Taoshanzhonghua, Shengzhong, Benditiezhong, and Xichangzhong, respectively (Figure 2A,B). The results showed that the highest ratio of PRO/NAP was in Shengzhong, and the lowest one was in Taoshanzhonghua (Figure 2C). Although the accumulation of PRO has no significant difference in the three varieties, NAP was the highest in Taoshanzhonghua (Figure 2A), which resulted in the lowest ratio of PRO/NAP in this genotype.To analyze the contents of PRO and NAP in the roots, stems, leaves, and flowers from the Chinese kale of the Shengzhong variety, HPLC analysis was used to investigate the glucosinolate components. In this study, nine glucosinolates were clearly detected (Figure S1), including 2-hydroxybut-3-enyl-GSLs (progoitrin, PRO), 4-(methylsulfinyl)butyl GSLs (glucorasphanin, RAA), 2-propenyl GSLs (sinigrin, SIN), but-3-enyl GSLs (gluconapin, NAP), 4-hydroxyindol-3-ylmethyl GSLs (4-hydroxyglucobrassicin, 4OH), 4-pentenyl GSLs (glucobrassicanpin, GBN), indol-3-ylmethyl GSLs (glucobrassicin, GBC), 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl GSLs (4-methoxyglucobrassicin, 4ME), and 1-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl GSLs (neoglucobrassicin, NEO). The content of PRO was 0.36, 0.23, 0.87, and 0.99 mg g-1 DW in the leaves, stems, roots, and flowers, respectively (Figure 2D). The content of NAP was 1.63, 5.19, 11.29, and 15.85 mg g-1 DW in these four tissues (Figure 2E). The ratio of PRO/NAP was the highest in the leaves, followed by the roots (Figure 2G). The total glucosinolate content was the highest in the roots, and then the flowers, stems, and leaves (Figure 2F).The content of PRO and NAP was investigated in Chinese kale seedlings treated by high and low temperatures for three days. The results showed that the PRO content increased significantly in both the leaves and roots treated by a high or low temperature (Figure 2J,K). The level of NAP, the precursor substance of PRO, also increased significantly in the leaves and roots after 40  C treatments (Figure 2I). The NAP content increased significantly in the leaves after 4  C treatments but did not change significantly in the roots after 4  C treatments (Figure 2H).2.2. Isolation of ODD Homologues and the Promoters from Chinese KaleThe Brassica oleracea ODD genes (LOC106342562, LOC106342186, and LOC106342567) were used as reference sequences for primer design. Four cDNA sequences were cloned from the genotypes Shengzhong and Taoshanzhonghua (designated as BocODD1, BocODD2, BocODD3, and BocODD4). The sequences of four cDNA were compared, but SNPs were not identified between these two genotypes. Meanwhile, the corresponding DNA sequences and promoter sequences were obtained by electronic cloning (Supplementary Data 1). The open-reading fragment (ORF) varied from 1077 to 1086 bp (Figure 3B), encoding proteins of 359-361 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 30122.56-40230.23 kDa (Supplementary Table S2). The instability index of the four genes was no more than 40, which indicated they were stable proteins. The values of the grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) were negative (Supplementary Table S2), showing that they were all hydrophilic proteins.The promoter sequences of four BocODDs were analyzed on the PlantCARE website. Besides some basic response elements (light-response element, TATA-box, endosperm expression, etc.), the promoter sequences also contain hormone response elements, for example, the cis-acting regulatory element involved in MeJA-responsiveness, auxin responsiveness, abscisic acid responsiveness, and a gibberellin-responsive element. Importantly, a series of MYB and MYC element sites were identified, which may be involved in drought-inducibility, light response, or other functions (Figure 3A).2.3. Amino Acid Sequence Analysis of BocODD GenesThe alignment analyses indicated that the four deduced BocODD proteins were highly conserved and all of them contained a conserved domain of oxoglutarate/iron-dependent dioxygenase (Figure 4). The amino acid sequences of BocODDs shared 75-82% similarity with the ODD protein from Arabidopsis (At2g25450) (Supplementary Table S2). The BocODDs sequences were queried for similarity against the GenBank data using the BLASTP program. The homologous sequences obtained were mainly from crucifer plants, such as Arabis alpina, Brassica cretica, Capsella rubella, Brassica oleracea, and so on. A phylogenetic tree was constructed, which indicated that BocODD1~3 shared the same clade with the proteins from the Brassica plants including B. oleracea, B. rapa, and Br. napus. Interestingly, unlike BocODD1-3, BocODD4 was clustered with amino acid sequences from C. rubella, R. sativus, and C. sativa (Figure 5), which indicated that the function of BocODD4 may be different from the other three BocODDs and AtODD (AT2G25450). In addition, the amino acid sequences of BocODD3 were about 90 amino acids shorter than BocODD1 and BocODD2, which indicated that BocODD3 may not be involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis. According to the results above, we chose BocODD1 and BocODD2 for a further analysis of their gene functions.2.4. Expression Analysis of BocODD1/2 in Chinese KaleThe expression patterns of BocODD1 and BocODD2 were analyzed in the Chinese kale genotypes Shengzhong, Taoshanzhonghua, Benditiezhong, and Xichangzhong. The results showed that BocODD1 and BocODD2 were most highly expressed in the genotype Shengzhong and had lower expression levels in the other genotypes (Figure 6A). The expression levels of BocODD1 and BocODD2 in the roots, stems, leaves, and flowers were detected. BocODD2 had the highest expression levels in the leaves followed by the roots (Figure 6B). The expression level of BocODD1 was higher in the roots and flowers than leaves and stems (Figure 6B).Glucosinolate is usually involved in the stress response in plants. Therefore, the expression of BocODD1 and BocODD2 may be induced by abiotic stress. In the present study, the expression levels of BocODD1 and BocODD2 increased significantly after 40  C and 4  C treatments compared to the control plants (25  C treated for 4 h). The expression levels of the two genes increased about 3-10 times after treatment at 4  C and 40  C compared to the control plants (Figure 6C).2.5. Function Analysis of BocODD1/2 in the Conversion of 3-Butenyl Glucosinolate to 2-Hydroxy-3-Butenyl GlucosinolateTo study the function of the BocODD1 and BocODD2 genes in Chinese kale, over-expression and RNAi were performed on the plants using an Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation. Two BocODD1 overexpression lines (OE-ODD1-1 and OE-ODD1-8), two BocODD2 overexpression lines (OE-ODD2-3 and OE-ODD2-5), and two RNAi lines (RNAi-ODD-9 and RNAi-ODD-26) were used for further study. Their T1 plants were used for phenotypic and molecular analyses. The morphologies of the transgenic plants and wild type (WT) plants had no significant difference with respect to leaf type, plant type, plant height, color, etc. (Figure 7D-F).The expression level of BocODD1 in the transgenic plants OE-ODD1-1 and OE-ODD1-8 were higher than the wild type plants. The expression level of BocODD2 was 2.4 and 2.5 times higher, respectively, in the OE-ODD2-3 and OE-ODD2-5 compared to the wild type plants (Figure 7G,H). The expression level of BocODD1 and BocODD2 in RNAi-ODD-9 was one-sixth that of the WT, while the expression level of BocODD1 was significantly lower in RNAi-ODD-26 compared to that of the WT plants. The expression level of BocODD2 in both of the RNAi plants was significantly lower compared to the WT plants (Figure 7I).To identify the function of BocODD1, 2 in the biosynthesis of glucosinolate, the concentrations of PRO and NAPwere determined in transgenic plants. The results showed that the content of PRO was 0.62 and 1.17 mg g-1 DW and the ratios of PRO/NAP were 0.07 and 0.13 in the OE-ODD1-1-2 and OE-ODD1-8-11 plants, respectively, which were significantly higher than the WT1 plants (0.03 ). However, the content of NAP was not significantly changed in the overexpression plants OE-ODD1-1-2 and OE-ODD2-3-11 (8.73 and 8.77 mg g-1 DW) compared to the WT1 plants (7.44 mg g-1 DW). The level of PRO was significantly decreased in RNAi-ODD-9 (0.04 mg g-1 DW) and RNAi-ODD-26 (0.04 mg g-1 DW) compared to the WT2 plants (0.08mg g-1 DW). The NAP was significantly higher in RNAi-ODD-9 (2.47 mg g-1 DW) and RNAi-ODD-26 (3.36 mg g-1 DW) compared to the WT2 plants (0.99mg g-1 DW), which also resulted in the PRO/NAP level being significantly lower (Table 1)."}, "35406047": {"doi": "10.3390/nu14071434", "title": "Is Bitterness Only a Taste? The Expanding Area of Health Benefits of Brassica Vegetables and Potential for Bitter Taste Receptors to Support Health Benefits", "abstract": "The list of known health benefits from inclusion of brassica vegetables in the diet is long and growing. Once limited to cancer prevention, a role for brassica in prevention of oxidative stress and anti-inflammation has aided in our understanding that brassica provide far broader benefits. These include prevention and treatment of chronic diseases of aging such as diabetes, neurological deterioration, and heart disease. Although animal and cell culture studies are consistent, clinical studies often show too great a variation to confirm these benefits in humans. In this review, we discuss causes of variation in clinical studies, focusing on the impact of the wide variation across humans in commensal bacterial composition, which potentially result in variations in microbial metabolism of glucosinolates. In addition, as research into host-microbiome interactions develops, a role for bitter-tasting receptors, termed T2Rs, in the gastrointestinal tract and their role in entero-endocrine hormone regulation is developing. Here, we summarize the growing literature on mechanisms of health benefits by brassica-derived isothiocyanates and the potential for extra-oral T2Rs as a novel mechanism that may in part describe the variability in response to brassica among free-living humans, not seen in research animal and cell culture studies.", "intro": "1. IntroductionBrassicaceae (previously termed Cruciferae), known as the mustard family, is composed of a large number of species that are of great economic and nutritional importance. One of the important genera in this family is the genus Brassica, which includes vegetables that are consumed worldwide, such as broccoli, kale, brussels sprouts, cabbage, rape, cauliflower, and turnip. Brassica vegetables are a good source of vitamin C, calcium, magnesium, phenolics, tocopherols and carotenoids, as well as dietary fiber. However, a unique group of compounds present in brassica vegetables that is considered to be particularly beneficial to health is the glucosinolates (GSLs), or, more precisely, one group of metabolites of GSLs, the isothiocyanates (ITCs). It is important to note that intact GSLs are not nearly as bioactive as their ITC metabolites. When GSLs are hydrolyzed by either plant beta-thioglucosidase or gut microbiota, the ITCs derived from GSLs are highly bioactive compounds. Therefore, the physiological benefits of brassica vegetables are not only dependent on the amount/frequency of consumption, but also on the presence of hydrolyzing enzyme activity.Over the past several decades, a large number of studies focusing on physiological effects of brassica GSLs have been reported, with findings of ITCs' activities in anti-inflammation, chemoprotection, neuroprotection, anti-obesity, and modulation of gut microbiota, both in clinical studies and in animal/cell culture models. As a result of rapid development in metagenomic sequencing techniques, the impact of brassica consumption on host microbiota has begun to unfold. However, in clinical studies, despite numerous animal and cell culture studies suggesting the physiological benefits of brassica and their ITCs, there remains substantial interindividual variation in the extent of conversion of GSL to ITC:and thus in the resulting absorption and bioactivity of ITCs. This variability is sufficiently large that it most frequently disrupts the ability of clinical trials utilizing diverse populations to determine significance for any effects. Here, we discuss recent updates in health benefits of ITCs and factors causing variation in ITC formation that interfere with clinical verification of these benefits, with particular focus on the impact of commensal bacteria on GSL metabolism. In addition, we summarize data supporting the developing idea of a role for ITC in health effects via activation of extra-oral bitter taste receptors (T2Rs).", "results": "2. Metabolism of Glucosinolates and Resulting ITC Bioavailability: A Key Source of Variability in Health Benefits2.1. Metabolic Fate of GlucosinolatesGSLs are secondary metabolites of brassica with a common structure that comprises a sulfonated oxime moiety, linked with a beta-thioglucose group and a variable aglycone side chain derived from one of several amino acids. The structure of the amino acid precursor determines the classification of GSLs: (1) aliphatic (i.e., glucoraphanin, sinigrin), from Met, Ala, Leu, Ile, and Val; (2) aromatic (i.e., gluconasturtiin), from Phe and Tyr; (3) indolic (i.e., glucobrassicin), from Trp. The content and types of GSL in brassica vegetables are affected by species, cultivation conditions, location in the plant, as well as the post-harvest treatment and cooking conditions. Although more than 130 GSLs have been identified in plants, glucoraphanin (GRP), sinigrin, gluconasturin, and glucobrassicin are the main GSLs in commonly consumed brassica vegetables.In the whole plant, GSLs are relatively stable because the beta-thioglucoside glucohydrolase, called myrosinase, is stored in myrosin granules, away from the GSLs. When there is tissue damage (i.e., cutting, chewing, insects biting), myrosinase gains access to and hydrolyzes GSLs, removing glucose to form an unstable intermediate that rearranges to form an ITC, indole-3-carbinol, nitrile, or epithionitrile, depending on the GSL side chain, pH, the presence of ferrous ions, and the presence of different specifier proteins. Neutral pH favors the formation of ITCs, whereas an acidic pH favors the formation of nitriles. The formation of a nitrile is also favored by the presence of ferrous ions and any of a group of plant specifier proteins called epithiospecifier protein (ESP), thiocyanate forming protein (TFP), and nitrile specifier protein (NSP). If the side chain has a beta-hydroxyl group, the unstable intermediate cyclizes spontaneously to form oxazolidin-2-thione. Epithionitriles are formed from GSLs containing an unsaturated terminal side chain. Different cooking conditions and food matrices (such as heating time and temperature, microwaving time and power level, volume of water added, and cutting size) impact the chemical composition of the food ingested, the conversion of GSLs to ITCs, and thus the extent of bioactivity. For example, sulforaphane (SF, the ITC metabolite of GRP) production from broccoli sprouts is significantly increased by preheating the sprouts to 60  C for 10 min, destroying the very heat-sensitive ESP (the plant protein that favors the formation of nitriles over ITCs during hydrolysis). However, it then significantly decreases when broccoli sprouts are further heated above 70  C and up to 100  C, temperatures that destroy myrosinase.When plant myrosinase is denatured by heating, both gut microbiota and supplementation of exogenous myrosinase have been shown to enhance the conversion of GSLs to ITCs. The variation in individuals' gut microbiomes then plays an important role in the variation seen in the extent of conversion of GSLs to active ITCs in the gut.Although a small amount of GSL (i.e., 5% of an oral dose of GRP) may be absorbed intact, most GSLs are hydrolyzed without absorption by the plant myrosinase and/or gut microbiota (Figure 1). The metabolism of GSLs to ITCs often starts in the mouth, where raw brassica vegetables are chewed and GSL is cleaved by myrosinase to release ITC. Studies investigating metabolism of brassica have mainly focused on GRP and its ITC metabolite SF. Once converted from GRP, SF is absorbed by the enterocyte, most likely through passive diffusion and then is rapidly conjugated to glutathione inside the cell. This conjugate then enters the circulation, travelling to the liver where it is further metabolized through the mercapturic acid pathway to form SF conjugates of cysteinylglycine (CysGly), and cysteine (Cys). A further metabolite, N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), is formed in the kidney. Any hepatic conjugate may be excreted back into the gut lumen via multidrug resistance protein 2 (MRP2), for passage through the bile duct to the gut. This is followed by reabsorption (termed enterohepatic circulation) or fecal excretion. GRP metabolites in urine are mainly NAC (least reactive, most water-soluble metabolite), with some free SF, SF-Cys, and SF-CysGly.2.2. Microbial Metabolism of GlucosinolatesWhen plant myrosinase is inactivated by cooking brassica vegetables, intact GSLs travel to the lower gut, where gut microbiota with myrosinase-like activities hydrolyze them to bioactive ITCs. Compared to the rapid absorption and excretion of ITCs after eating raw brassica, the absorption and excretion of ITCs is both diminished and delayed when cooked brassica are eaten, since there is a significant time delay before GSLs get to the lower gut and undergo hydrolysis by the gut microbiota (Figure 1). In clinical studies, NAC conjugate excretion was found to peak between 3 and 6 h after eating raw cabbage, compared with a peak between 9 and 12 h after eating cooked cabbage.The microbial transformation of GSLs is of great interest since this supports formation of ITCs from brassica consumption, regardless of the cooking method employed, and thus provides greater possibilities for the therapeutic effect of brassica diets. Interestingly, in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) mouse model of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), it was found that both raw broccoli (with active plant myrosinase) and lightly cooked broccoli (plant myrosinase greatly inactivated) were equally effective in protecting the host from DSS-induced colitis, for most of the endpoints, including the clinical score for colitis (disease activity index, DAI), colon length, and lesion severity, with exceptions in gut barrier integrity and proinflammatory markers' mRNA expression. Compared to raw broccoli, where SF is rapidly released in the mouth and absorbed in the stomach, SF in cooked broccoli is slowly released in the lower gut. Although it is unknown how much of the SF released in the lower gut was due to the remaining myrosinase activity in the partially cooked broccoli, it is possible that SF released from cooked broccoli in the colon by microbial transformation, and some active plant myrosinase directly ameliorated the colitis, even though the total dose of SF may be less than that from raw broccoli. Future studies should evaluate the health benefits of alternate brassica vegetable preparation in conditions that only partially inactivate myrosinase activity and thus impact the location and source of ITC production.Individual bacterial species capable of metabolizing GSL have been extensively reviewed and found to spread across diverse bacterial phyla, including members of Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinomycetes, and Proteobacteria. They include both Gram-positive and Gram-negative, as well as commensal and pathogenic bacteria. Among these, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria have drawn much research interest for another reason: their widely known probiotic properties. Their potential as probiotics has caused the dietary supplement industry to market these bacteria, which may have the serendipitous effect of improving GSL hydrolysis. Further study is needed in this area. Little is known regarding bacterial myrosinase sequences or mechanism of activity. To date, the only known bacterial myrosinase was isolated from a Citrobacter strain (WYE1) from soil. A recent study reveals an operon, BT2160-BT2156, within a prominent human gut microbial species:Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron:that appears to be required for hydrolysis of GSLs, providing possible insight into an underlying mechanism of gut bacterial hydrolysis of GSLs. Other aspects of bacterial metabolism of GSLs, such as the location of the microbial myrosinase (i.e., intra- or extracellular) or how the bacteria manage the antimicrobial properties of ITCs, are also little understood and need further study.Emerging animal and clinical studies have focused on understanding the impact of brassica consumption on the composition of the host gut microbiota and their metabolic function, as well as host health in general. The response of the commensal microbial community to a brassica vegetable diet has been shown to vary. A few studies have shown consistent changes in bacterial composition with brassica consumption. In rats, Akkermansia manuciphila was consistently found to be increased by brassica vegetables. However, more commonly seen across studies are variations in bacterial composition (at the family and genus levels) after brassica consumption in human and animal studies. Quite varied responses of human commensal microbiota to dietary brassica have been found among hosts, which suggests that the host species/environment, and the basal microbiota structure may affect results. In clinical studies, highly variable conversion rates of GSLs to ITCs have been reported, ranging from 1% to 40%, following identical oral administration of a broccoli sprouts extract, suggesting that prior individual differences in gut microbial communities lead to variation in GSL bioactivation rates.2.3. Alternative Pathways of Microbial Metabolism of GlucosinolatesAlthough in vivo and in vitro assessment of GSL metabolites have identified many bacteria with myrosinase-like activities that support formation of ITCs, the transformation rates found to date are relatively low. Recent studies with insect herbivores that eat a variety of brassica (brassica specialists) have identified several additional metabolic pathways for GSLs (Figure 2). As ITCs can be toxic at high concentrations, the gut microbiota of these insects have evolved to avoid ITC accumulation. For example, one mechanism is to further degrade ITCs into nontoxic metabolites. The gut microbiota of cabbage root fly larvae has been shown to hydrolyze ITCs into an amine and a carbonyl sulfide (Figure 2). The amine is then used as a nitrogen source for the microorganism. Another mechanism is the removal of the sulfate group on GSLs by a sulfatase. As the sulfate group is essential for the rearrangement that occurs after myrosinase reacts with GSLs, sulfate removal results in disruption of ITC production, leading to nontoxic desulfo-GSLs that cannot break down to ITCs. Furthermore, the desulfo-GSLs could provide a valuable glucose molecule to gut microbes that exhibit sulfatase and thiohydrolase activity, so that GSLs become an energy source, without toxicity from ITCs (Figure 2). There are several studies showing human gut bacteria with sulfatase activity that form desulfo-GSL in vitro.The dynamic interactions between brassica vegetables and the gut microbiota still lack basic mechanistic knowledge. It is unclear whether the increased efficiency in GSLs' transformation to ITCs seen following prolonged exposure to brassica diets also leads to increased microbial breakdown of ITCs to nontoxic metabolites. It is important to note that all of these pathways may occur concurrently within the gut microbiota, yet little is known about how brassica consumption may impact these pathways or how these competing pathways may explain the individual variation in the conversion of GSLs to ITCs seen in clinical studies."}, "36833404": {"doi": "10.3390/genes14020476", "title": "Glucosinolate Biosynthetic Genes of Cabbage: Genome-Wide Identification, Evolution, and Expression Analysis", "abstract": "Cabbage (Brassica oleracea var. capitata) is a vegetable rich in glucosinolates (GSLs) that have proven health benefits. To gain insights into the synthesis of GSLs in cabbage, we systematically analyzed GSLs biosynthetic genes (GBGs) in the entire cabbage genome. In total, 193 cabbage GBGs were identified, which were homologous to 106 GBGs in Arabidopsis thaliana. Most GBGs in cabbage have undergone negative selection. Many homologous GBGs in cabbage and Chinese cabbage differed in expression patterns indicating the unique functions of these homologous GBGs. Spraying five exogenous hormones significantly altered expression levels of GBGs in cabbage. For example, MeJA significantly upregulated side chain extension genes BoIPMILSU1-1 and BoBCAT-3-1, and the expression of core structure construction genes BoCYP83A1 and BoST5C-1, while ETH significantly repressed the expression of side chain extension genes such as BoIPMILSU1-1, BoCYP79B2-1, and BoMAMI-1, and some transcription factors, namely BoMYB28-1, BoMYB34-1, BoMYB76-1, BoCYP79B2-1, and BoMAMI-1. Phylogenetically, the CYP83 family and CYP79B and CYP79F subfamilies may only be involved in GSL synthesis in cruciferous plants. Our unprecedented identification and analysis of GBGs in cabbage at the genome-wide level lays a foundation for the regulation of GSLs synthesis through gene editing and overexpression.", "intro": "1. IntroductionGlucosinolates (GSLs) are an important class of plant secondary metabolites. Currently, about 200 GSLs are known, which are distributed in 16 families of dicotyledonous plants, especially in Brassicaceae. The GSL hydrolysis products display diverse bioactivities, function both in defence and as an attractant in plants, play a role in cancer prevention in humans, and act as flavour compounds. Due to their effects on both plants and humans, GSLs are a current biology research focus. Indeed, rapeseed breeders focus on harmful GSLs in rapeseed cakes, vegetable breeders are more interested in anticancer GSLs that are beneficial to humans, and medical scientists focus on GSLs that are inhibitory to tumor cells. Sulforaphane, a secondary metabolite, relieves neuropathic pain caused by chemotherapy and inhibits prostate, colon, breast, pancreatic, and bladder cancers.Structurally, all GSLs comprise a beta-D-glucopyranose residue linked through a sulfur atom to a (Z)-N-hydroximinosulfate ester plus an R side-chain group derived from an amino acid (AA). Based on different AA sources of R groups, GSLs can be divided into three categories: aliphatic GSLs (R side chains are derived from methionine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine), aromatic GSLs (R side chains are derived from amino acids containing aromatic rings, tyrosine, and phenylalanine), and indole GSLs (R side chains are derived from tryptophan). The GSL synthetic pathway has been thoroughly studied in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The biosynthesis of glucosinolates can be summarized into three stages: extension of the R side chain, synthesis of the core structure, and modification of the side chain (Figure 1) Figure 1 is quoted from references.Cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata L.) is an important cruciferous vegetable that is rich in GSLs and widely grown globally. Although the whole-genome sequence of cabbage is available, there is a paucity of studies on cabbage GSL biosynthetic genes (GBGs). Therefore, to gain an in-depth understanding of the regulatory mechanism of GSL synthesis in cabbage, we conducted genome-wide identification, evolution, and expression analyses of cabbage GBGs using the Arabidopsis GSL synthesis pathway as a reference. This study establishes a reference for improving the composition and content of cabbage GSLs through molecular breeding technologies.", "results": "3. Results3.1. Identification of Glucosinolate Biosynthetic Genes in B. oleraceaGlucosinolate biosynthetic genes from A. thaliana (AtGBSs) were used to identify B. oleracea glucosinolate biosynthetic genes (BoGBGs). A total of 193 BoGBGs were identified (Table S1), of which 169 BoGBGs were syntenic orthologs of the 106 AtGBGs (Figure 2). Based on the genome annotation file, 169 BoGBGs were mapped to nine chromosomes. As shown in Figure 3, there were 18, 25, 26, 15, 17, 16, 18, 14, and 20 BoGBGs located on chromosomes C01-C09, respectively.3.2. Comparative Evolutionary Analyses of Orthologous Gene Pairs of Glucosinolate Biosynthetic GenesTo explore the selection pressure acting on GBGs in B. oleracea, A. thaliana and B. rapa, Ka/Ks values for BoGBGs, BrGBGs and AtGBGs were comparatively analyzed. Ultimately, 20 homologous gene pairs of GBGs were selected (Figure 4). The Ka/Ks values of GBGs in B. oleracea, B. rapa, and A. thaliana were similar. However, the Ka/Ks ratios of BoMAM1-1, BoST5a-1, BoSUR1-1, and BoAOP1-1 were slightly lower in B. oleracea than in B. rapa genomes. Except for BoST5a, Ka/Ks values were all less than one, indicating that most genes were under negative selection (Figure 4).3.3. Expression Analysis of Glucosinolate Biosynthetic Genes Orthologs from B. oleracea, B. rapa, and A. thaliana genomesThe expression levels of BoGBGs and BrGBGs in different tissues (callus, flower, leaf, root, silique, and stem) were analyzed based on a publicly available transcriptomic dataset. The transcript levels of 133 glucosinolate biosynthetic genes were assessed (Table S2). From the heatmap visualization, 20 BoGBGs and BrGBGs, which were important for glucosinolate synthesis, were expressed (Figure 5). Seven of these genes had the highest and lowest expression levels in the siliques and roots, respectively: BoUGT79B1-1, BoFMOG5-1, BoSUPR1, BoBCAT-4-1, BoMAM1-1, BoCYP83A1-1, and BoCYP79F1. By contrast, the expression levels of BoAOP1-1, BoPYK10-,1 and BoTBS-1 were highest in the roots and lowest in the siliques. Some genes were highly expressed in cabbage leaves, such as BoBCAT-3-1, BoCYP79A2-1, BoCYP79B2-1, BoST5a-1, and BoGSTF9-1. BoCYP81F2-1, BoGMT1-1, and BoGSH2-1 were barely expressed, except in the callus. BoST5a-1 had the lowest and highest expression levels in the stems and leaves, respectively. BoST5a-2 was expressed in all tissues and had the highest and lowest expression levels in the roots and flowers, respectively. BoAOP1-1 had the highest expression levels in the roots and stems.The different expression patterns of orthologous gene pairs indicate possible functional differentiation. We found that BoMAM1-1 displayed the highest expression levels in the siliques and stems, whereas BrMAM1-1 displayed the highest expression levels in the roots. BoCYP79A2-1 was highly expressed in the leaves, whereas the expression levels of BoCYP79A2-2 and BoCYP79A2-3 were the highest in the roots. However, BrCYP79A2-1 was highly expressed in the stems and BrCYP79A2-2 and BrCYP79A2-3 were highly expressed in the flowers. Our results showed that some homologous genes in B. oleracea and B. rapa have different expression patterns, indicating that the functions of these genes possibly diverged with speciation.The tissue expression of important genes in the glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway was analyzed to further understand the expression of GBGs in B. oleracea (Figure 6). The results showed that BoST5a-1 and BoST5a-2 were expressed in all organs, including the calluses, flowers, leaves, roots, siliques, and stems, while BoST5a-3 was only expressed in the flowers. The expression of BoCYP79A2-1 was highest in the leaves, calluses, and siliques, followed by the stems, flowers, and roots. Almost no expression of BoCYP79A2-1 was detected in the roots. Meanwhile, the expression of BoCYP79A2-2 was only expressed in the roots. BoCYP79A2-3 was expressed in the flowers and roots. BoMAM1-1 and BoMAM1-3 were expressed in all tissues. The expression of BoAOP1-1 was in the roots, stems, and calluses, and no expression or weak expression was observed in other tissues. Gene expression analysis revealed an extensive variance between paralogs of each GBGs.3.4. Twelve Glucosinolate Biosynthetic Genes Respond to Exogenous Phytohormone TreatmentsTo investigate the effects of different exogenous phytohormones on GBG expression, we sprayed cabbages with ETH, ABA, SA, MeJA, and SL (Figure 7).At 100 mg/L, ETH promoted the expression of two genes (BoCYP83A1 and BoMAM1-1) 2 h after treatment. The expression of BoBCAT-3-1 decreased 4 h after treatment. The expression levels of the remaining genes (BoIPMILSU1-1, BoSUPR1-1, BoST5C-1, BoCYP79A2-1, BoCYP79B2-1, BoMYB34-1, BoMYB28-1, BoMYB76-1, and BoCYP79F1-1) were not affected.At 50 mg/L, ABA promoted the expression of 10 genes (BoIPMILSU1-1, BoBCAT-3-1, BoMYB28-1, BoCYP79B2-1, BoMYB34-1, BoMYB76-1, BoCYP83A1, BoST5C-1, BoMAM1-1 and BoSUPR1-1). Two other genes (BoCYP79A2-1, BoCYP79F1-1) were significantly repressed within 24 h of treatment.Treatment with 100 micromol/L of SA promoted the expression of five genes (BoIPMILSU1-1-1, BoBCAT-3-1, BoMAM1-1, BoMYB34-1, and BoSUPR1-1). Specifically, the expression of BoIPMILSU1-1-1 and BoBCAT-3-1 was promoted 4 h after treatment and that of BoMAM1 and BoMYB34-1 12 h after treatment. The expression of BoSUPR1-1 was promoted between 4 h to 12 h after treatment. Six genes were completely repressed: BoCYP79A2-1, BoCYP79F1-1, BoMYB28-1, BoCYP79B2-1, BoMYB76-1, and BoST5C-1. BoCYP83A1 was promoted up to 4 h after treatment and repressed thereafter.The expression of five genes (BoCYP79A2-1, BoCYP79B2-1, BoMYB34-1, BoMYB76-1, and BoCYP79F1-1) was repressed by treatment with MeJA at 100 micromol/L. Two genes (BoIPMILSU1-1 and BoMYB28-1) were initially promoted and then repressed. The expression of BoST5C-1 was not promoted within 24 h of treatment.Treatment with 5 micromol/L SL promoted the expression of BoMAM1-1 and BoCYP83A1 12 h and 2 h after treatment, respectively. The expression levels of other selected genes were unaffected by SL treatments.3.5. Evolutionary History of P450 Genes among Seven Plant SpeciesThe cytochrome P450 gene family is important for plant development as it is largely involved in the synthesis and metabolism of plant hormones, pigments, and fatty acids. In this study, P450 genes were identified in B. oleracea and six other representative plant species. As shown in Figure 8, 48 genes clustered into four clades (CYP78, CYP79, CYP81, and CYP83). BoCYP83A1 and BoCYP83B1 clustered with the CYP83 family (blue area), whereas BoCYP79F1, BoCYP79A2, BoCYP79B3, BoCYP79B2-1, and BoCYP79B2-1 clustered with the CYP79 family (yellow, green, and pink area)."}, "25222144": {"doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0107123", "title": "Regulatory Network of Secondary Metabolism in Brassica rapa: Insight into the Glucosinolate Pathway", "abstract": " Brassica rapa studies towards metabolic variation have largely been focused on the profiling of the diversity of metabolic compounds in specific crop types or regional varieties, but none aimed to identify genes with regulatory function in metabolite composition. Here we followed a genetical genomics approach to identify regulatory genes for six biosynthetic pathways of health-related phytochemicals, i.e carotenoids, tocopherols, folates, glucosinolates, flavonoids and phenylpropanoids. Leaves from six weeks-old plants of a Brassica rapa doubled haploid population, consisting of 92 genotypes, were profiled for their secondary metabolite composition, using both targeted and LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics approaches. Furthermore, the same population was profiled for transcript variation using a microarray containing EST sequences mainly derived from three Brassica species: B. napus, B. rapa and B. oleracea. The biochemical pathway analysis was based on the network analyses of both metabolite QTLs (mQTLs) and transcript QTLs (eQTLs). Co-localization of mQTLs and eQTLs lead to the identification of candidate regulatory genes involved in the biosynthesis of carotenoids, tocopherols and glucosinolates. We subsequently focused on the well-characterized glucosinolate pathway and revealed two hotspots of co-localization of eQTLs with mQTLs in linkage groups A03 and A09. Our results indicate that such a large-scale genetical genomics approach combining transcriptomics and metabolomics data can provide new insights into the genetic regulation of metabolite composition of Brassica vegetables.", "intro": "Introduction Brassica crops are important food sources (oil, vegetables and condiments), and are considered to have beneficial nutritional properties such as antitumoral activities. The presumed healthy components such as phenylpropanoids, phenolics, flavonoids and glucosinolates have been widely characterized in Brassica . For example, Brassica leaves have been found to accumulate conjugated forms of both flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin) and flavones (apigenin and luteolin). In recent years, breeding for nutritional quality became an important research topic and in this context metabolomics approaches, using NMR, LC-MS and or GC-MS, have enabled the parallel assessment of the relative levels of a broad range of metabolites. In Arabidopsis, a Brassica rapa relative, the metabolite variation was found to be abundant and its genetic regulation complex, plausible candidate regulators could be identified after LC-MS mass peaks were assigned to genomic loci.The components of the metabolome can be regarded as the end products of expressed genes and define the biochemical phenotype of a cell or tissue. Several complementary analytical methods can be applied in order to enable profiling, either relatively or quantitatively, of the various chemical classes of metabolites present in an organism.Transcriptomics measures the variation in mRNA transcript abundance and expression profiles can be treated as heritable traits to genetically map expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL); this type of analysis has been denominated as genetical genomics.Thus, the integration of metabolomics with transcriptomic and genomic platforms has frequently been used as a strategy to identify candidate genes involved in the regulation of the levels of specific metabolites in plant systems  . The investigation of selected biochemical pathways of pre-defined metabolites showed that the connections between gene expression and metabolite variation are complex.The variation in B. rapa morphology is huge (oil, turnip, pak choi, Chinese cabbage and several Asian leafy morphotypes) and the variation in metabolite composition is similarly large. This variation has increased the interest of plant breeders to breed for improved phytonutrient quality in Brassica. Several studies in A. thaliana, B. rapa and B. napus aimed to identify QTL for phytonutrients. The most studied secondary metabolites are the glucosinolates and the detected QTL not only confirmed the quantitative nature of this trait, but also allowed the identification of key biosynthetic and regulatory genes (Hasan et al. 2008, Kliebenstein, 2001,Lou et al. 2008, Wentzel et al. 2007, Feng et al. 2012).The triplicated genome of B. rapa has a well described synteny with Arabidopsis . As a consequence of the evolutionary gene triplication event, many genes have paralogues. The triplicated nature of the Brassica genome represents a challenge to unravel the genetics of metabolic traits using genetical genomics approaches.In the present study we profiled both metabolite and transcript abundance in the leaves of six weeks-old plants from a Doubled Haploid (DH) population developed from an F1 cross between a yellow sarson (R500) and a pak choi (PC175) plant. We applied both an untargeted metabolomics approach for semi-polar secondary metabolites, including glucosinolates, flavonoids and phenylpropanoids, using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and targeted analytical approaches to profile lipid-soluble isoprenoids (carotenoids and tocopherols) and folates. Additionally, the whole genome transcript level was performed on leaves of six week old plants from all DH lines using a distant pair design with a 60-mer oligo microarray assembled using EST sequences mainly from three species: B. napus, B. rapa and B. oleracea . To prioritize the number of candidate genes, we subsequently focused on six known biochemical pathways of health-related phytonutrients, with the aim to identify regulatory genes. Furthermore, for the construction of a transcriptional regulatory network we used the very well described glucosinolate pathway. These data are an important reference for breeding purposes and a step to gain insight in the genetic factors responsible for the metabolite variation in B. rapa.", "results": "ResultsGenetic linkage map of DH68A genetic linkage map was constructed for population DH 68. A total of 456 markers were mapped in the DH population (Figure S1). The total map length was 1233.221 cM and consisted of 10 linkage groups, corresponding to the 10 chromosomes of Brassica rapa. The largest linkage group was A03 with a size of 192.22 cM and the smallest linkage group was A04 with a size of 63.646 cM. Each of the linkage groups had at least one SSR marker, which allowed the identification of the corresponding chromosome and the comparison with previously published maps. In addition to the SSR markers, gene targeted markers related to the glucosinolate pathway were mapped in this population as well. A total of 21 markers related to the glucosinolate (GLS) biosynthetic pathway were mapped in all the linkage groups except for A08, A05,A04 and A10. The linkage group with most GLS genes mapped was A03 with eight genes mapped. The mapping of this particular group of markers together with the SSRs was of aid for the identification of the map orientation and for further syntenic comparison with Arabidopsis thaliana in the search of candidate genes for metabolic pathways and cis/trans effects.Whole genome QTL analysis of metabolic contentMaking use of targeted metabolic extraction and analyses procedures, including quantification using reference compounds, it was possible to measure the variation in absolute levels of selected health-related phytochemicals, i.e. tocopherols, carotenoids and folic acid, in the leaves of B. rapa. The parental line YS-143 produced significantly more of gamma-tocopherol, alpha-tocopherol, lutein, beta-carotene and folate than the parental line PC-175. Variation of carotenoids, tocopherols and folate within the DH population are presented in Table 1. A transgressive segregation for the quantity of content of these targeted compounds was observed: most of the levels were transgressive in a positive and negative direction. QTL analysis of these targeted compounds revealed significant mQTL regions LOD >3 distributed across the whole genome table S2. Overlapping QTL regions, with a possible regulatory function for more than one carotenoid, were located on linkage groups A03, A05 and A10. No significant results were found for delta-tocopherol. (Figures S2, S3, S4).The LC-MS untargeted profiling resulted in the identification of 228 reconstructed metabolites; from this set 41 were identified as corresponding to the flavonoids pathway (Table S3).Significant mQTLs were detected for 166 out of the 228 reconstructed metabolites (i.e. 73%). These mQTL were not equally distributed over the B. rapa linkage groups, as coldspots and hotspots for the genetic regulation of metabolite content could be identified (Figure 1). The most important regulatory region was located on linkage group A07, where mQTLs were detected for 47% of all LC-MS metabolites.Whole genome QTL analysis of transcriptomics data and candidate gene filteringWe followed a regression analysis of the transcript abundance represented by 78,278 informative probes on the microarray against 456 mapped markers. In total, 44,358 probes were detected as significant against a genetic marker with a LOD score >3.5.The whole genome profile of the number of eQTL versus chromosome position indicates that there is no evidence of eQTL clustered as hotspots. Instead, the eQTL were distributed randomly across the genome with a higher number than average on linkage groups A02, A03 and A09. (Figure 2).In general, to identify regulatory genes we searched for genomic regions in which metabolite levels (mQTL) seem to co-localize with significant LOD values of annotated probes (eQTL) corresponding to candidate genes of their biochemical pathway. While the region in linkage group A07 was detected as a hotspot for mQTLs, no eQTLs were observed among the known biosynthetic genes. However, when the complete set of probes with a significant LOD score of more than 3.5 in linkage group A07 was filtered for GO terms related to flavonoid regulation, we could identify three probes representing genes involved in positive regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis. (Table S4)For most metabolites we could identify at least one eQTL overlapping with one mQTL. Only for alpha-tocopherol, having a QTL on linkage group A02, none of the annotated probes showed an eQTL at the same genomic region, and also for folic acid we were unable to identify probes that co-localize with its mQTL in A05 and A09, even when the selected LOD value of the annotated probes was lowered to LOD  = 3. In general we were able to identify cis and trans eQTLs for the target metabolites in several linkage groups. The eQTL results corresponding to each pathway are summarized in table S5 and figures S2, S3, S4.Additionally, correlation analysis was performed between all the significant probes, annotated as known regulatory genes or transcription factors, with eQTL LOD scores >3.5 and a correlation value >0.3. The correlation analysis indicated a high within and between pathway correlation (Figure 3). The highest correlation values >0.8 were found between eQTLs results from different paralogs and between different genes belonging to the flavonoid pathway.Glucosinolate mQTLs AnalysisTo further analyze the regulatory network of a specific phytochemical pathway we focused on the very well characterized glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway (Figure 4).The parental lines yellow sarson (R500) and a pak choi (PC175) are known to differ in their metabolic and genetic compositions. We detected 20 glucosinolates in the parental lines and within the DH population (Table S6). Significant mQTLs were detected for 13 out of the 20 glucosinolates, mostly representing aliphatic glucosinolates, while mQTLs were not detected for the aromatic glucosinolate and for two out of the three indolic glucosinolates.The mQTLs representing 12 aliphatic glucosinolates showed co-localization mostly in the genomic regions on linkage groups A03 and A09 (Figure 5). This co-localization indicates a high genetic correlation between glucosinolates. In the case of linkage group A03, mQTLs were found for the long chain aliphatic glucosinolates and in A09 the mQTLs were mostly detected for the short-chain (C3 to C5) aliphatic glucosinolates and their modified forms. In the case of the indolic glucosinolates we could identify one mQTL for neoglucobrassicin, which was located in linkage group A02. This mQTL had a lower LOD score value in comparison to the LOD scores for aliphatic glucosinolates.Transcriptional regulation of the glucosinolate pathwayIn an effort to enrich the genetic map with informative markers, we mapped genetic markers related to the glucosinolate pathway in the different linkage groups. Although we found significant gene expression QTLs (eQTLs) for the regulation of glucosinolate metabolism in all the chromosomes, two hot spots were identified in chromosome A03 and A09 (Figure 4, 6). Along linkage group A03 three positions were identified as important because of the co-localization of significant eQTLs. At top of chromosome A03 (38.4 cM) we mapped a genetic marker for the GLS transcription factor Myb29, while a putative eQTL representing Myb 29 was found at 22.4 cM (with LOD of 2.1, which is lower than the significance threshold). At the Myb29 eQTL position at 22.4 cM, we found co-localizing eQTLs representing GLS biosynthesis genes: 2CYP79F1A06, 1-2CYP83A1A04, 2BCAT4A05, 2GSL-OHA03(2) and 2UGT74C1A05. We mapped a marker for GSL-OH at the middle of chromosome A03 (70.4cM), while the eQTL for the probe representing GSL-OH mapped in an interval spanning the same location. The GSL-OH eQTL interval co-located with the genetic map position of 3IPMISSU1A03 and 1MAM1A03. At the lower bottom position of A03, eQTL corresponding to 3IPMISSU1A03 and 1-2MAM1A03 colocalized at the position where a genetic marker for BCAT4 was mapped (121.1 cM). Finally, also in linkage A03, cis-regulation was found for the MAM gene, as the 1-2MAMA03 probe showed an eQTL at the position of the MAM genetic marker (126.0 cM). In addition, the same MAM probes had a significant eQTL at the position of a Myb28 marker (mapped at 127.2 cM on A03), although we did not find a Myb28-eQTL at this position.Along linkage group A09 several regions were identified as eQTL hotspots. Many regions in linkage group A09 showed either colocalization of eQTLs or cis-effect of genes, which have been mapped at the corresponding positions in this population.The Myb28 eQTL mapped at the Myb28 genetic locus (30.7 cM), where also significant eQTL colocalized for 1-2AOP2A01, 1AOP2A03, 2CYP79F1A06, 2CYP83A1A04, 1SUR1A09, 2BCAT4A03, 2BCAT4A05(2), 2FMOGS-OX2A09(2), 2GSTF6A02, 2UGT74B1A09, and 2ST5b(SOT18) A07 (2). The gene BrC-lyase (SUR1) was cis regulated, as eQTL (57.8 cM) and SUR1genetic marker (56.5 cM) colocalized. At the same position of the SUR1 eQTL the genes 2FMOGS-OX2A09 and 2UGT74B1A09 also had an eQTL. In an eQTL interval between 73.7 and 83.7cM on A09 the genes: 1AOP1A01, 2AOP2A01, 2GSTF6A02, 1AOP2A03, 2MAM1A03, 1MYB29A03, 2BCAT4A03, 2BCAT4A05(2), 2UGT74C1A05, 2CYP79F1A06, 1-2 (2) ST5b (SOT18) A07, 1MYB51A08, 2SUR2A08, 2MYB28A09, 1SUR1A09, 2FMOGS-OX2A09(2), 2BrBCAT3A01 and 2UGT74B1A09 had eQTL, suggesting that this is an important trans regulatory locus. Within this interval a genetic marker for UGT74B1 was also mapped, which could point to a regulatory role for this gene. Finally, within this linkage group at the position of the genetic marker for the transcription factor BrMYB51 (130.2 cM) significant eQTL were found for the following genes: 1MYB29A09, 2MYB28A09 and FMOGS-OX2A09 (2). The marker for FMOGS-OX5 was also mapped at the 136.8 cM position, and thus this gene is likely cis regulated.Glucosinolate Biosynthesis in Brassica rapa The comparison of the mQTL and eQTL data revealed several GLS biosynthesis genes and transcription factors involved in the regulation of glucosinolate biosynthesis in B. rapa (Figure 6). In linkage group A03, for example, we were able to dissect the genetic function of the paralog of GSL-OH in A03 in the biosynthesis of progoitrin: its mQTL colocalized with both the eQTL and the genetic marker for 2GSL-OHA03 (2). In linkage group A03 at the large interval containing the eQTLs for 3IPMISSU1A03 and 1-2MAM1A03, the mQTLs for gluconapin, glucoraphanin, heptyl (I, II, III) and hexyl III glucosinolates co-localized within the region where genetic markers for the MAM gene and for the BrBCAT4 gene mapped. In linkage group A09 overlapping mQTLs were found for glucobrassicanapin, glucoerucin, gluconapin, hexyl-GLS III, methylsulphonylbutyl-GLS and progoitrin. These mQTLs co-localized at the interval containing several eQTLs and the genetic marker for UGT74B1.In summary, for the eQTL analysis a total of 94 probes were selected as representatives of candidate genes for the GLS pathway. Forty-two from these 94 probes, representing 25 candidate genes, showed at least one eQTL. These genes had both cis and trans eQTL in most hotspots in the genomic regions at A03 and A09, with most of the genes showing trans-eQTL effects at the position of Myb29 in A03, and both UGT74B1 and Myb28 in A09."}, "25030463": {"doi": "10.1093/dnares/dsu024", "title": "Associative Transcriptomics Study Dissects the Genetic Architecture of Seed Glucosinolate Content in Brassica napus", "abstract": "Breeding new varieties with low seed glucosinolate (GS) concentrations has long been a prime target in Brassica napus. In this study, a novel association mapping methodology termed 'associative transcriptomics' (AT) was applied to a panel of 101 B. napus lines to define genetic regions and also candidate genes controlling total seed GS contents. Over 100,000 informative single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and gene expression markers (GEMs) were developed for AT analysis, which led to the identification of 10 SNP and 7 GEM association peaks. Within these peaks, 26 genes were inferred to be involved in GS biosynthesis. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis provided additional 40 candidate genes. The transcript abundance in leaves of two candidate genes, BnaA.GTR2a located on chromosome A2 and BnaC.HAG3b on C9, was correlated with seed GS content, explaining 18.8 and 16.8% of phenotypic variation, respectively. Resequencing of genomic regions revealed six new SNPs in BnaA.GTR2a and four insertions or deletions in BnaC.HAG3b. These deletion polymorphisms were then successfully converted into polymerase chain reaction-based diagnostic markers that can, due to high linkage disequilibrium observed in these regions of the genome, be used for marker-assisted breeding for low seed GS lines.", "intro": "IntroductionGlucosinolates (GSs) are secondary metabolites mainly found in the family of Brassicaceae which includes rapeseed (Brassica napus L.), the globally important oil crop. Some breakdown products of GS have an anti-nutritional value for livestock, thus making it necessary to breed for rapeseed varieties with low GS (<30 mol g-1) in seeds. However, modern varieties with low GS in seeds tend to be associated with a concomitant reduction of the GS content in leaves, and thus they are more susceptible to insects and diseases such as Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. For this reason, it is desirable to reduce the GS contents within seeds so that the cake is suitable for fodder and yet maintain the disease-protective effects of high GS contents in other organs. As a prerequisite for this aim, candidate genes for GS biosynthesis and transportation in rapeseed must be identified.The chemical structure of GS comprises a thioglucose moiety, a sulphonated oxime, and a side chain derived from aliphatic or aromatic amino acids, or tryptophan. There are three basic steps for GS biosynthesis in plants, i.e. amino acid chain elongation, GS skeleton formation, and side-chain modification. To date, nearly all genes responsible for biosynthetic steps have been identified, leading to the clarification of the core pathway of GS biosynthesis in Brassicaceae (Supplementary Fig. S1). The GSs are believed to be synthesized mainly in rosette and silique walls and then relocated actively to embryos through phloem by specific transporters. Blocking the reallocation of GS from vegetative organs to embryos could be an effective way of reducing GS concentrations in seeds without affecting other tissues. This concept has been supported by the most recent identification of GTR1 and GTR2 that encode a GS transporter in Arabidopsis. In the gtr1 gtr2 double-mutant plants, the GS content was found to be reduced by 100% in seeds but with a 10-fold increase in rosette.Quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis is a powerful method to study the genetics underpinning quantitative variation in GS profiles. For total GS accumulation in the seeds, seven QTLs have been identified on several linkage groups in rapeseed. More recently, Feng et al. identified 105 metabolite QTLs that had an effect on the GS concentration and constructed an advanced metabolic network for the GS composition in both leaves and seeds of rapeseed. Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is another powerful tool of identifying genes associated with complex traits, which has several advantages over bi-parental QTL mapping. The number of GWASs conducted is rapidly increasing, and it has resulted in the discovery of genes for tocopherol, carotenoid, and oil content in maize, and genes underlying important traits such as flowering time and grain yield in rice. Studies regarding GWAS in rapeseed have gained attention in recent years. The overall level of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in 85 winter rapeseed genotypes was found to be very low, with a mean r2 of 0.027. A structure-based association study using gene-linked simple-sequence repeat markers revealed that four genes were associated with the total GS content in seeds. Most recently, a panel of 472 rapeseed lines were further applied to a GWAS of seed weight and seed quality traits, leading to the identification of four clusters of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) highly associated with the GS content.With the rapid development of the new biotechnology, especially the emergence and application of next-generation sequencing technologies such as Illumina (Solexa) sequencing, a considerable progress in the accumulation and distribution of Brassica genome data has been made in recent years. These endeavours have resulted in a 95-k unigene set and 41,211 SNPs publicly available for Brassica community (Brassica genome gateway; ). More recently, the massively parallel RNA sequencing (mRNA-Seq) was also applied to dissect the genome of B. napus at transcriptome level, which led to the development of some 23,000 SNP markers and the construction of an ultradensity linkage map in B. napus. Moreover, gene expression variation (i.e. gene expression marker, GEM) for each unigene can also be inferred from the same set of mRNA-Seq data, providing additional ca. 189,000 GEMs for both A and C genome. With the huge amount of markers (SNPs and GEMs) derived from mRNA-Seq, an improved GWAS method termed 'associative transcriptomics' (AT) was proposed to overcome the difficulties (e.g. the complexity of polyploidy and the lack of reference genome sequences to order SNPs) that hinder GWAS in B. napus. The novel AT methodology has been proved in a relatively small panel, and the orthologs of HAG1 (also known as MYB28), the key player in the regulation of aliphatic GS biosynthesis in Arabidopsis (Supplementary Fig. 1), were discovered to be vital for GS variation in B. napus. However, due to the small number of lines used, the power of AT has not been fully exploited, and many other candidate genes for GS as well as their allelic variations in the germplasm have yet to be characterized. The aim of this study is to address the genetic control of GS natural variation in B. napus using AT. This has been achieved by genotyping a panel of 101 lines by mRNA-Seq and phenotyping the total GS content in seeds. Four consensus association peaks and also many candidate genes involved in the GS pathway were identified. The identification of candidate genes not only furthers our understanding of the gene network for GS biosynthesis but also provides markers for the breeding of low GS rapeseed varieties.", "results": "ResultsPhenotypic variation of total GS concentration in seedsSeeds of 101 B. napus lines were harvested and measured for total GS concentration using NIRS (Fig. 1). The GS content for each line ranged from 8.0 to 195.6 mumol g-1, with an average of 65.3 mumol g-1. The coefficient of variation was estimated as high as 73.2%, a sign of wide variation for GS concentrations in this panel. Thus, it is suitable for association mapping. Moreover, 41% of lines were classified as low GS (<30 mumol g-1), one of the two key characteristics for the canola quality in rapeseed. The GS concentrations for Tapidor and Ningyou7 (two parents of the widely used mapping population TNDH) were 19.0 and 85.7 mumol g-1, respectively, which were very close to previous results (19.9 and 78.6 mumol g-1).Genotyping of B. napus linesRNA was isolated and sequenced from each of 101 B. napus lines, providing a total of >200 Gb of 80-bp sequence reads (under accession numbers: ERA122949, ERA036824, and ERA063602). By mapping sequence reads to a reference sequence comprising the Brassica unigene set, a total of 225,011 SNP markers were called (Supplementary Table S2). Among these markers, 80,880 with minor allele frequencies (MAF) <0.05 were removed, and the remaining 144,131 SNP markers were further mapped onto specific genomes. As expected, only a few of these markers could be mapped onto either A (7580) or C (7673) genome, which are very useful for anchoring genetic loci to a specific genome location; the majority (89.4%) was mapped onto both genomes, because A and C genome sequences are highly similar.The GEM, expressed as RPKM value of a unigene, can also be inferred from the mRNA-Seq data. This exercise provided a total of 189,116 GEMs, with 94,558 on A and C genomes. Among these GEMs, 49,599 and 50,935 were shown to be informative (i.e. RPKM > 0 for at least some lines) on respective A and C genomes; thus they were also used for marker-trait association study.Genetic structure and LDThe 144,131 informative SNPs were first used for genetic structure analysis. Again, all B. napus lines can be largely divided into two clusters by the Bayesian clustering algorithms implemented in STRUCTURE, one of which consists of most winter-type lines and the other of spring-type, swede, and kale lines (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Table S1).To facilitate comparison, the 15,253 mapped SNP markers that have been previously used in a smaller panel were again used for LD analysis in 101 lines. The extent of LD was gauged by calculating pairwise r2 for the mapped SNPs using an LD window of 500 (providing >30,000 pairwise values of r2). The mean LD across the whole genome was 0.0209, which is close to the previous estimates of 0.0246 in a subset of these lines and confirms the low overall level of LD in B. napus.The strength of LD was also measured across each chromosome pseudomolecule. As an example, there were several small but strong LD blocks (r2 > 0.2) in A2 (Supplementary Fig. S4a). Meanwhile, two large LD blocks sit on both ends of C9 (Supplementary Fig. S4b).Loci associated with the GS concentrationSNPs and GEMs were separately used for AT study on total GS concentration in seeds. Firstly, 144,131 informative SNPs were regressed with the GS trait using a MLM implemented in TASSEL, leading to the identification of 10 association peaks at a Bonferroni threshold of P < 6.9 x 10-6 (i.e. P = 1/144,131; -log10P = 5.2) (Supplementary Fig. S5a). These peaks were located on A2, A3, A6, A9, C2, C3, C4, C7, and C9 (Table 1). It is not surprising that some peaks on the A genome are very similar to those on the C genome, owing to the fact that most SNPs were mapped onto both A and C genomes. The well-defined peaks were found on A2, A3, A6, A9, C2, C3, and C9, within which there were foci to identify candidate genes for GS. However, P-values erroneously fail to be significant for markers in multiple comparison tests when analysing a large number of SNPs. Therefore, we used an ad hoc threshold of 10-4 to assess genomic regions underlying association peaks for the presence of candidate genes. In all, 255 SNPs were found to be highly associated with GS, which were derived from 110 unigenes (Supplementary Fig. S6). Of the 110 unigenes, only 2 were directly implicated in the GS metabolism pathway (Table 2), and the proteins encoded by the remaining 108 genes were classified as transcription factors, factors responding to stimulus or involved in cellular process, catalytic activity, or with unknown functions (data not shown).  Secondly, 100,534 GEMs were then regressed (simple linear regression) with GS concentrations, which resulted in the identification of seven association peaks located on A2, A4, A9, C2, C4, C7, and C9 at P < 9.9 x 10-6 (i.e. P = 1/100,534; -log10 P = 5.0) (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S5b). A total of 352 GEMs (262 unigenes) were screened within these peaks at P < 10-4. Of these unigenes, 22 have also been identified by SNPs (Supplementary Fig. S6). Moreover, 24 unigenes detected by GEMs were shown to be directly involved in GS metabolism (Table 3). This number is 12 times of those captured by SNPs, demonstrating that the GEM analysis is more powerful than the SNP analysis in terms of capacity of screening candidate genes for GS. Collectively, a total of 607 marker loci and 17 association peaks were found to be associated with GS in respective SNP and GEM analyses. Among these peaks, five co-located on A2, A9, C2, C7, and C9 (Table 1). Interestingly, four out of the five common peaks locate in the same intervals of previous QTLs for total GS contents (Fig. 2). Within these peaks, the previously characterized orthologs of HAG1, a gene encoding transcription factor for GS biosynthesis, were re-identified by both SNP and GEMs (Tables 2 and 3), indicating the robustness of AT results. Distribution pattern of GEMsThere was a well-defined association peak on A2. Interestingly, GEMs within this peak showed a distinct clustering pattern, as reflected by the existence of a gap (i.e. some GEMs clustered at -log10P > 6.2 while the others at <4.9) (Supplementary Fig. S5b). Actually, the eight GEMs clustering at the top of this peak were highly correlated with each other (P < 0.01), and two of them have similar functions (encode methylthioalkylmalate synthase, MAM) in GS biosynthesis, whereas the other six encode proteins with unknown functions. This observation indicated that genes involved in the GS pathway may tend to be located in close proximity to each other and have similar expression patterns, resulting in this clustering of GEMs.Gene co-expression analysis for GSGEM analysis has the additional advantage that it can be used for WGCNA to dissect the biological process underlying traits. This approach was used to construct a co-expression network for the GS concentration that contained 122 modules (co-expressed genes), with between 31 and 16,989 unigenes in each module. The 'lightblue4' module was highly correlated with the total GS content of seeds (r = 0.55; P = 2.0 x 10-8) (see also Supplementary Fig. S7). This module comprises 91 unigenes (114 GEMs), of which 40 were implied to be involved in GS biosynthesis (Supplementary Table S3).Then, a co-expression network was constructed with probes (genes) from 'lightblue4' module to identify the relationships between genes highly associated with GS metabolism. It was found that the unigene JCVI-16890, the Arabidopsis ortholog of which encodes a plastidic bile acid transporter (BAT5), is in the central node in this network. Other hub genes in this network included JCVI_12709 and JCVI_30455, the orthologs of which encode branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase (BCAT/MAAT) and MAM1, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S8). All these genes have been shown to play key roles in the GS biosynthesis pathway in Arabidopsis (Supplementary Fig. S1).GO analysis was further performed with unigenes from the 'lightblue4' module to construct a biological metabolism network. As a result, most of the genes are enriched in the biological process related to GS synthesis, such as carbohydrate metabolic process and cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process in the initial stage and later in the GS biosynthetic process and sulphur amino acid biosynthetic process. Meanwhile, a few genes encode proteins for cellular components responding to external stimulus (Supplementary Fig. S9).Identification of DNA polymorphism by re-sequencingApproximately 66 candidate genes involved in the GS metabolic pathway have been identified by either AT or WGCNA (Tables 2 and 3 and Supplementary Table S3). Some genes of interest were further selected to investigate and verify the potential associations of allelic variation of genes with phenotypic variation in the association panel. This was achieved by amplifying and re-sequencing PCR products using lines with various GS contents in seeds.The first unigene of interest is JCVI_13343 (BnaA.GTR2a); the Arabidopsis ortholog encodes proteins for transporting GS compounds from leaf to seed. BnaA.GTR2a is located in a genomic region within the peak on A2 (Fig. 3a), and its expression was positively correlated with the accumulation of GS in seeds (r = 0.43, P < 10-4), accounting for 18.8% of trait variation (Supplementary Fig. S10a). Although there were nine known SNPs (at positions 469, 625, 655, 667, 688, 775, 860, 861, and 952) within this unigene, none of them was strongly associated with GS. To detect the potential new sequence variation (i.e. insertion or deletion, InDel) within this locus, specific primers were designed and used to amplify the complete unigene (ca. 600 bp) from 42 lines. By sequences alignment, all nine known SNPs were re-identified although some of them were not polymorphic (as only a subset of lines were analysed), and six were previously unidentified SNPs (at positions 538, 565, 571, 640, 727, and 748) (Supplementary Table S4). These results confirmed the robustness and efficiency of SNP development via mRNA-Seq in B. napus. However, none of the 10 polymorphic SNPs (at positions 469, 538, 565, 571, 640, 655, 727, 748, 860, and 861) were correlated with the GS content (r < 0.11, P > 0.500) and thus were not likely to be causative for trait variation. Another unigene of interest is EX043693 (BnaC.HAG3b), which is located within the peak on C9 which coincides with a region of strong and extensive LD (Fig. 3b). In Arabidopsis, HAG3 (MYB29) is a transcription factor modulating many genes in the GS pathway. Expression of BnaC.HAG3b is highly associated with GS accumulation (r = 0.41, P < 10-8) and accounts for 16.8% of trait variation (Supplementary Fig. S10b). However, no SNPs have been detected by mRNA-Seq within this gene. Therefore, genomic regions covering the length of EX043693 were amplified from 70 lines and then sequenced to detect potential DNA sequence variations. By comparing sequences of these DNA fragments, four InDels, i.e. InDel3-1 (3-bp insertion), InDel3-2 (3-bp deletion), InDel7 (7-bp deletion), and InDel1 (1-bp deletion), were detected. These InDels formed two haplotypes: haplotype I includes the 3-bp insertion and 11-bp (i.e. 3 plus 7 plus 1) of deletions, while haplotype II has the sequence identical to the reference unigene EX043693 (Fig. 4). A total number of 60 lines were determined as haplotype I at these loci and 10 lines as haplotype II. The average GS concentration of haplotype I (56.3 micromol g-1) was only 55% of that of haplotype II (the wild type), consistent with the net 8-bp (frame-shift) deletion reducing the functional properties of the encoded protein. To facilitate germplasm screening and marker-assisted selection for the low GS content, a pair of specific PCR primers was designed, which only captures the 11-bp deletions so that the polymorphism can be more easily resolved by agarose gel (Fig. 4). An example of PCR amplification is given in Fig. 5; the haplotype I and II lines can be clearly distinguished by the presence of a 226-bp- and 237-bp-specific fragment, respectively. Thus, the polymorphism at BnaC.HAG3b locus has been successfully converted into a PCR-based marker.

In the present study, chemical changes were determined for two genotypes with different genetic background, and included seedling, young leaves, mature leaves, tuber surface, tuber core, stalk, flower and seed tissues, at seven different time points during plant development.

This analysis was complemented by a gene expression analysis, focussed on GLS biosynthesis, which could explain part of the observed variation, pointing to important roles of specific gene orthologues for defining the chemical differences. Substantial differences in glucosinolate profiles were observed between above-ground tissues and turnip tuber, reflecting the differences in physiological role. In addition, differences between the two genotypes and between tissues that were harvested early or late during the plant lifecycle.

GLS are water-soluble compounds that derive from glucose and amino-acids such as methionine, tryptophan or phenylalanine. The core structure of all GLS consists of thioglucose and sulphate groups, which are conjugated to an amino-acid derived side chain. Side chains can be aliphatic or indolic or aromatic, vary in chain length and can undergo several modifications (Fig 1). In plants, GLS have a role to protect the plant from insect damage, both in leaves and in underground tissues. In vegetables, GLS provide a variety of tastes like bitterness and pungency. Upon damage to plants, e.g. by chewing, GLS are enzymatically converted into a range of volatile compounds, like nitriles and isothiocyanates (ITCs). In addition to taste formation GLS have been reported to be implicated in both antinutritional and health-promoting effects. Progoitrin, a GLS known from several brassica species, has anti-thyroid activity and promotes goitre disease. On the other hand, a high consumption of Brassica vegetables correlates negatively with the incidence of degenerative diseases in numerous epidemiological studies. Protective effects are often accredited to GLS breakdown products such as ITCs, nitriles and indoles. There is increasing evidence that ITCs are involved in cancer prevention and have anti-inflammatory effects (reviewed in).Previous work has shown that turnip varieties differ widely in their GLS content and composition. Generally GLS composition is measured in either the green parts of turnips, or in the tubers, and these data suggest that the GLS composition of tubers differs strongly from that of leaf tissue. This is likely the result of tissue-specific regulation of GLS biosynthesis, transport and/or storage, which is affected by both the genotype of the plant and the environment. Only recently a single study compared GLS composition in both leaves and tubers of several turnip accessions. In addition, global GLS composition has recently been analyzed in leaves and roots in ecological studies.Breeding towards new turnip varieties with specific GLS composition may be in the interest of consumers in view of their contribution to the nutritional quality of this vegetable. For such breeding activities, it is important to identify genetic loci controlling GLS biosynthesis and storage. In Arabidopsis thaliana, discovery of such loci has been strongly facilitated by a compact genome, a large set of well-characterized ecotypes and the availability of a large set of molecular biology tools. These genes include biosynthetic enzymes, regulatory transcription factors and transporters (Fig 1). For example, the locus GS-ELONG controls variation in the side-chain length of aliphatic glucosinolates, and maps to the MAM genes, encoding enzymes involved in chain elongation. The GS-OX locus controls the ratio between methylthioalkyl to methylsulfinylalkyl GLS, comprising five monooxygenase isogenes which mediate conversion of methylthioalkyl GLS. Two loci control the presence of hydroxylated aliphatic GLS. The AOP locus encodes dioxygenases which convert methylthioalkyl GLS to either hydroxyalkyl GLS (AOP3), or alkenyl GLS (AOP2). The GS-OH locus encodes another dioxygenase, which converts alkenyl GLS to 2-hydroxyalkenyl GLS. In addition, several studies describe transcription factors that regulate GLS biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. For instance, MYB28, MYB29 and MYB76 were all identified as positive regulators for the production of aliphatic GLS of different chain lengths, which reciprocally trans activate each other, while MYB29 also plays a role in jasmonic acid-induced aliphatic GLS biosynthesis. MYB51 and MYB34 were identified in A. thaliana as regulators of indolic GLS. Recently, GLS transporters have been identified, that import GLS from the apoplastic space to the symplast. More loci controlling GLS variation, GLS storage and GLS breakdown in Arabidopsis have been reviewed.Genetic research of non-model species such as turnip benefits from the pioneering work in Arabidopsis, since biochemical pathways in B. rapa are not fundamentally different from those in Arabidopsis. However, the tuber tissue from turnips is absent from the architecture of Arabidopsis, and acts both as a sink during vegetative development, and as a source during generative development of the plant. In view of this important physiological role, the identification of genetic loci determining the specific GLS composition in turnip tuber tissue is relevant. While the Arabidopsis genome is compact, the B rapa genome is the result of a genome triplication from a common ancestor of B. oleracea and B. rapa. Gene loss, due to genome fractionation after the triplication event, has led to the disappearance of gene paralogs. Gene loss is not a random process, as some gene classes are more strongly retained compared to others. In two genome wide studies orthologues of A. thaliana GLS genes and their genetic positions in B. rapa were identified showing that many paralogues had been retained. Different paralogues likely have different roles depending on plant genotype, age and organs, yet this has barely been studied. For example, showed that the three MYB28 paralogues in B. rapa, each of them encoding a functional protein, have clearly distinct expression patterns, with one copy expressed in none of the tissues tested.In the present work, the accumulation of 11 GLS forms in different tissues and developmental stages of two turnip accessions has been investigated, revealing the dynamics of GLS accumulation during the lifecycle of B. rapa. This information was complemented by a gene expression analysis, probing expression of a range of B. rapa paralogues of genes that have been identified as relevant for GLS biosynthesis, regulation and transport in Arabidopsis. Subsequently it is discussed in how far this information can be deployed to preselect genetic loci and markers for breeding for specific GLS content and composition in turnip.", "results": "ResultsGLS analysisTwo accessions of turnip, FT-004 from Denmark and FT-086 from Pakistan, were selected from a previous analysis, since their development proceeded synchronously, with regard to turnip tuber formation and flowering. On the other hand, GLS content of their tubers and leaves differed strongly. Plants of both accessions were raised in a large number of replicates in a complete block design under identical conditions, and material from seedlings, juvenile and adult plants was collected including young leaves, mature leaves, tuber core, tuber surface, stem, flowers and seeds at different time points (Table 1). Intact GLS were extracted from these materials and analysed by LC-MS. Eleven different GLS were identified, and their relative levels in the different samples were compared. A list of GLS and the specific masses used for quantification are presented in S2 Table while the relative levels of the GLS are presented in S4 Table.Global variation in GLS contentPrinciple component analysis (PCA) of GLS data was performed to visualize the observed differences in samples based on their differential GLS profiles (Fig 2A). The first principal component (PC), explaining 44% of the total variation, mostly corresponds to the different tissues. In particular, the tuber samples, from both skin and core, separated from all the above-ground tissues, including seedlings, leaves, flowers, seeds and stems. The second PC, which explained 25% of the total variation, clearly separates the two turnip accessions. These differences between tissues and accessions are due to differences in specific GLS, as is clear from the PCA-loading plots visualizing the distribution of GLS species across the various turnip samples (S1A Fig). We tested whether there were significant effects of genotype, tissue and time-point and their interactions on the content of individual GLS (S5 Table). For both time and tissue-type, significant (p<0.05) effects were observed for all GLS. There was also a significant genotype effect for all GLS, except for BRAS and NAS. Most interactions were also significant, however for several GLS there was no interaction between time and genotype. GLS were addressed in more detail to reveal which GLS are at the basis of the global differences observed in the PCA (Fig 2).Genotype specificity for GLSAccessions FT-004 and FT-086 differed in many GLS from each other (Fig 3). Glucoberteroin (BER; Fig 3B) was detected at much higher levels in tubers of FT-004 than of FT-086. FT-004 had also a much higher content of gluconapoliferin (NAPOL; Fig 3F), both in tubers and in young leaves. Similarly, the amount of 4-hydroxybrassicin (4-HBR; Fig 3H) was generally much higher in FT-004 tissues than in FT-086. On the other hand, glucoerucin (ERU; Fig 3A) levels were higher in FT-086; also gluconapin (NAP; Fig 3C) was higher in FT-086, although in young leaf material this was much less pronounced than in tuber material and in mature leaf material.Tissue specificity for GLSTurnip tubers display a more diverse GLS complement than turnip leaves. For example, ERU and BER occurred in well-detectable levels in tubers, but were hardly detectable in leaves, stem, flower or seed (Fig 3A and 3B, S4 Table). Also NAS was highest in tubers, compared to the other tissues. Gluconeobrassicin (NeoBr; Fig 3G), on the other hand, was more abundant in leaves. It may be of interest to note that tissues like flowers, stems and seeds, which only occurred after winter had passed, generally compare well to leaf material, and do not contain exceptionally high levels of GLS (S4 Table).GLS during development of the plantFew GLS decreased during plant development. The relative content of BER and ERU in turnip tubers each were reduced during turnip maturation (T2-T5) in either genotype (Fig 3D, 3C and 3H). Interestingly, concentrations of the indole GLS such as NeoBr and 4HBr (Fig 3G and 3H) in leaf material dropped strongly in the transition from vegetative stages (T1-T5) to flowering stage (T6). For other GLS, such as CAN (Fig 3F) no such trends can be observed and levels seem to be rather constant during plant development. Interestingly, PRO did gradually decrease during plant development in leaves of FT086 and did not in FT004 (Fig 3E).Aliphatic GLS side chain modification in turnipWith regard to specific modifications on side-chains of aliphatic GLS, we observed that aliphatic GLS with a C5 side chain (BER, CAN, NAPOL) were generally more predominant in FT-004, while aliphatic GLS with a C4 side chain (ERU, NAP) were more dominant in FT-086. Also, the C5 aliphatic GLS with a 2-hydroxy group on the side chain (NAPOL) was exclusively detectable in FT-004, while its C4 counterpart (PRO) was present in comparable amounts in both genotypes. GLS with a methylthio- group terminating the aliphatic side chain (BER, ERU) occurred almost exclusively in turnip tubers, and hardly in above-ground tissues.GLS in F1 from a cross between FT-004 and FT-086GLS were profiled in tubers of the two parental genotypes and their F1 plants at 40 days after sowing (S4 Table). The F1 resembled the FT-004 parent for the aliphatic GLS, as the relative abundancies of the C5 GLS (BER, CAN and NAPOL) are much higher than those in FT-086. Their abundancies are however somewhat lower than in FT004 tubers, especially for BER and NAPOL (S2 Table).Gene expression analysisGenes (S3 Table) involved in aliphatic, indole and aromatic GLS pathways were selected from a collection of GLS genes identified in the B. rapa genome. Expression of these genes was tested in a limited number of samples (Fig 4), including seedlings, young leaves, old leaves, turnip core, turnip surface, bolt, flower and seed by quantitative RT-PCR, using paralog-specific primer pairs and actin as a reference gene (S6 Table; S6 Fig).Principle component analysis (PCA) of gene expression data was performed to visualize the observed differences in gene expression profiles (Fig 2B). The first component, explaining 40% of variation, separates different tissues. In particular, turnip tuber samples were separated from leaf tissue. Samples of seedlings were found amidst the leaf samples. The second component, which explains 15% of the total variation, seems to separate different harvest dates, as in the top quadrants predominantly T6 samples are positioned, while in the lower quadrants, leaves and turnip tubers from T2 and seedlings and seeds are found (S1B and S5 Figs). Clearly, global gene expression did not explain the observed differences in GLS profile. Therefore, a few individual genes were addressed in more detail to possibly explain observed differences in GLS profiles in turnip samples.GSOH Bra022920 is co-regulated with NAPOLThe relative abundance of the 2-hydroxylated GLS NAPOL in accession FT-004 could relate to a difference in expression of a paralog of Arabidopsis GS-OH. In Arabidopsis this enzyme catalyses the 2-hydroxylation of alkenyl-GLS. In the B. rapa genome, three paralogs of GS-OH have been identified: Bra212670, Bra021671 and Bra022920. These three paralogs displayed completely different behaviour (Fig 4B, 4D and 4F). Only Bra022920 is highly expressed in both leaf and turnip of accession FT-004, while its expression is hardly detectable in FT-086, consistently with the NAPOL concentration.AOP2 paralogs are oppositely regulated with BER and ERUThe absence of the methylthio GLS BER and ERU in above-ground tissues, and their presence in tuber tissue could relate to a difference in AOP2 expression. AOP2 in Arabidopsis is known to mediate the conversion of methylthio GLS into alkenyl GLS. All three paralogs of AOP2 (Bra000848, Bra018521 and Bra034180) were hardly expressed in tuber tissue, while much higher expressed in leaf tissue (Fig 4A, 4C and 4E). We hypothesize that AOP2 in leaves metabolizes BER and ERU, resulting in their very low levels in leaf tissue.Differences in GLS chain length and the expression of MAM genesOne of the striking differences between accessions FT-004 and FT-086 is the chain-length of their aliphatic GLS. In Arabidopsis, chain-length of GLS is known to be controlled by the GS-ELONG locus, where MAM1, MAM2 and MAM3 control chain length. In the B. rapa genome, three MAM1 genes (Bra013007, Bra029355 and Bra018524) and four MAM3 genes (Bra013009, Bra13011, Bra029356 and Bra021947) have been identified. Only the MAM3 paralogue Bra013009 is higher expressed in early stages of FT-004 than in FT-086 and could be responsible for chain elongation from C4 to C5 (S3 Fig).Gene expression suggests that the major sites of biosynthesis of aliphatic GLS are above-groundA correlation analysis of expressed genes in the B. rapa genotypes across all tested tissues of both accessions (S4 Fig) revealed strong correlations between MYB28 (both Bra012961 and Bra035929) and most of the tested aliphatic biosynthetic genes which was not the case for MYB29 (Bra005949). Remarkably, both MYB28 genes display a pattern where they are well expressed in the leaf materials, but poorly detectable in the tuber tissues."}, "29762546": {"doi": "10.3390/molecules23051186", "title": "Transcriptome Analysis in Chinese Cabbage (Brassica rapa ssp. pekinensis) Provides the Role of Glucosinolate Metabolism in Response to Drought Stress", "abstract": "Although drought stress is one of the most limiting factors in growth and production of Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L. ssp. pekinensis), the underlying biochemical and molecular causes are poorly understood. In the present study, to address the mechanisms underlying the drought responses, we analyzed the transcriptome profile of Chinese cabbage grown under drought conditions. Drought stress transcriptionally activated several transcription factor genes, including AP2/ERFs, bHLHs, NACs and bZIPs, and was found to possibly result in transcriptional variation in genes involved in organic substance metabolic processes. In addition, comparative expression analysis of selected BrbZIPs under different stress conditions suggested that drought-induced BrbZIPs are important for improving drought tolerance. Further, drought stress in Chinese cabbage caused differential acclimation responses in glucosinolate metabolism in leaves and roots. Analysis of stomatal aperture indicated that drought-induced accumulation of glucosinolates in leaves directly or indirectly controlled stomatal closure to prevent water loss, suggesting that organ-specific responses are essential for plant survival under drought stress condition. Taken together, our results provide information important for further studies on molecular mechanisms of drought tolerance in Chinese cabbage.", "intro": "1. IntroductionBecause the increasing world population and worldwide climate change affects agriculture in several ways, an intergovernmental panel on climate change has concluded that increased concentrations of greenhouse gases will lead to dry conditions in the subtropics, creating widespread drought stress in agricultural regions. Drought is considered as the dominant factor reducing crop growth and yield, and is expected to cause serious problems in plant growth and crop production over more than 50% of all agricultural lands by 2050. In addition, it has been shown that drought sensitivity in crops has increased over the past twenty years. Therefore, improving drought tolerance is a major goal for crop breeders. Under drought conditions, plants display various physiological and biochemical responses at the cellular and whole-plant levels, leading to a range of specific and nonspecific phenotypes. These responses include stomatal movement, repression of cell growth, development, and photosynthesis, and alteration in biosynthetic pathways, antioxidant pathways, and the respiration pathway, suggesting that drought tolerance is an outcome of a series of molecular, cellular, physiological, and biochemical processes mediated via induction and/or repression of genes and their regulation through complex transcriptional networks. This indicates that particular attention to drought-stress response genes and drought-stress-induced transcriptional networks will be required for successful yield protection against drought.Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa L. ssp. pekinensis) is a subspecies of B. rapa and is considered an economically important cruciferous vegetable in Asia, particularly in China, Korea, and Japan. Given its significant economic value and its genetically close relationship with Arabidopsis thaliana, Chinese cabbage has been used as a model crop for studies on functional genomics of Brassica species and the evolution of polyploid genomes. In addition, high-throughput techniques have been widely used for understanding molecular mechanisms in Chinese cabbage in response to environmental stresses. For example, transcriptome analysis using digital gene expression profiling suggested that genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) including NAC, MYB, HSF (heat shock factor), WRKY, bHLH (basic helix-loop-helix), and ERF (ethylene-responsive factors), antioxidant proteins (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione S-transferase), and proteins involved in osmolyte synthesis contribute to salt tolerance. Further, comparative transcriptome analysis of different varieties of Chinese cabbage has revealed common and variety-specific responsive transcripts, which can serve as a helpful resource to explore novel candidate genes for improving stress tolerance. Although further functional characterization of these genes will be essential to address how they modulate stress-tolerance, analysis of transcriptome changes help in understanding the molecular basis of plant adaptation to environmental stresses. Morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes in Chinese cabbage under drought conditions have been well-defined and extensively studied, yet little is known about the genome-wide responses of transcripts to drought stress.Recently, with the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) for transcriptome analysis has been widely used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among different treatment, tissues or growth periods, suggesting that RNA-seq is powerful tool to obtain an overall view of gene expression profiles. In the present study, to investigate the molecular basis of response to drought stress in Chinese cabbage, the transcriptomes of leaves and roots under drought conditions were analyzed using digital gene expression profiling. Drought stress-inducible or -repressible genes were identified, and further classified as common or specifically regulated. In addition, comparative analysis of DEGs in leaves and roots revealed the importance of glucosinolate metabolism in controlling the response to drought conditions. Taken together, our results provide an overview of molecular mechanisms triggered by drought stress in plants, and will be helpful in unraveling the basic mechanisms of environmental stress tolerance.", "results": "2. Results and Discussion2.1. Physiological Response to Drought Stress in Chinese CabbageDrought stress is a major abiotic stress, inducing accelerated production of several reactive oxygen species including superoxide, singlet oxygen, hydroxyl radicals, and H2O2 causing oxidative damage to proteins, DNA, and lipids in different cellular compartments. Therefore, oxidative stress markers including lipid peroxidation in terms of MDA, ROS accumulation, and protein carbonylation have been analyzed to identify variations in physiological response to drought stress. We analyzed the physiological responses of Chinese cabbage subjected to drought stress, to evaluate efficacy of the treatment. As shown in Figure 1B, drought stress induced significant changes in relative water content. The leaves of the plant showed accumulation of H2O2 (Figure 1C), MDA (Figure 1D), and protein carbonylation (Figure 1E), with their levels increasing 1.9-, 2.7-, and 2.7-fold respectively after four days of drought stress treatment (Stage 3), compared with those in the control plants (Stage 1) (Figure 1A). These physiological changes suggested that the drought stress treatment was effective, and the leaves and roots of Chinese cabbage plants grown under control conditions (Stage 1) and drought stress conditions (Stage 2 and Stage 3) were harvested to unravel the molecular basis of the response.2.2. RNA-Seq and Identification of Drought-Responsive GenesDuring the last decade, several exciting studies have reported the development of new disease-resistant crops using genetic engineering tools, but efforts to generate drought-tolerant crops has been less successful. This might be due to the complex responses of crops to drought stress. In fact, drought stress induces various morphological, physiological, and biochemical changes in crops controlled by numerous small-effect loci and hundreds of genes, indicating that knowledge of the biochemical and molecular responses to drought should contribute to improving plant tolerance under water-limited conditions. Therefore, to obtain a global overview of molecular mechanisms involved in drought stress response, total RNA was extracted from roots and leaves of control and drought-treated plants and used for generation of transcriptome libraries on an Illumina HiSeq  2500 sequencing platform. After removing low-quality reads, 46 to 54 million clear reads (4.64 to 5.49 Gb) from each sample were acquired for further analysis (Table 1).All reads were deposited in the National Agricultural Biotechnology Information Center (NABIC, ). To identify the DEGs in the control and drought-treated groups, we constructed six comparison groups, and DEGs were defined as genes with value of |log2 (fold change)| >= 1. As shown in Figure 2A, a total of 7535 DEGs (3557 up-regulated and 3978 down-regulated) were detected comparing the L1 and L2 libraries. Comparative analysis of the L2 and L3 libraries showed that the expression of 2666 genes was increased and that of 2608 genes was down-regulated in L3. Upon drought stress exposure, more DEGs were down-regulated in roots than in leaves (Figure 2A), indicating that the response mechanism against drought stress differs between roots and leaves. A total of 1280 genes were exclusively up-regulated in L2, and the expression levels of 1282 genes were increased in L3 but not in L2. In roots, transcripts of 1135 genes were down-regulated solely in R2, whereas 1752 transcripts were down-regulated exclusively in R3 but not in R2 (Figure 2B). Further, 467 DEGs from leaves and 240 DEGs from roots were found to be up-regulated in both tissues, whereas 424 DEGs from leaves and 1181 DEGs from roots were found to be down-regulated in both tissues (Figure 2B). Non-specific lipid-transfer protein 3 (XP_009132002.1), dehydrin Rab18-like (XP_013609020.1), and sucrose synthase 3 (XP_009111303.1) were among those identified to be up-regulated in both roots and leaves, whereas aquaporin TIP2-1 (XP_013653350.1) was down-regulated in both tissues.To understand the universal response of Chinese cabbage to drought stress, all screened DEGs in the six comparison groups were subjected to GO enrichment analysis, and 60 functional groups classified into three categories comprising \"cellular component,\" \"molecular function,\" and \"biological process\" were identified (Table S1). The category \"biological process,\" consisting of 27 functional groups, exhibited the highest number of annotations alongside \"cellular process\", followed by \"metabolic process\", and \"single-organism process\". In addition, the drought-induced DEGs revealed various affected metabolic processes, mainly the organic substance metabolic processes, cellular metabolic processes and primary metabolic processes (Figure 2C). Photosynthesis is one of the important processes affected by drought, due to changes including decrease in turgor pressure, reduction in CO2 assimilation and diffusion, and impairment in the photosynthetic apparatus, suggesting that alterations in primary metabolic processes under drought conditions (Figure 2C) are mediated via drought-induced photosynthesis inhibition. Further, transcript abundances of genes involved in the abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis and degradation pathway were dynamically changed in response to drought stress, whereas a number of genes involved in biosynthesis of auxin, gibberellin, or ethylene were down-regulated (Figure S1), suggesting that the hormonal regulation of drought stress response in Chinese cabbage is primarily mediated via ABA.2.3. Transcription Factors and MapMan Analysis of Chinese Cabbage Genes Associated with Drought-Stress ResponseTranscription factors (TFs) are known as major players in various transcriptional regulatory mechanisms in stress-induced signal transduction pathways. Therefore, understanding the role of stress-inducible TFs is important for engineering stress-tolerant plants by modulating a large set of genes. In Chinese cabbage transcriptome libraries generated in the above mentioned RNA-seq, a total of 3663 TFs mainly distributed into 45 TF families was found (Figure S2). Among these TFs, the most abundant differentially expressed TF family was the AP2/ERF family (Figure S3). Based on the difference in copy numbers and similarity of AP2/ERF domains, this family is further divided into five subfamilies, the Apetala2 (AP2), the ethylene responsive element binding factor (ERF), the Related to ABI3/VP1 (RAV), the dehydration-responsive element-binding (DREB) protein, and the Soloist, However, our transcriptome libraries did not contain members of the Soloist subfamily (Figure S4), probably due to its tissue-specific expression. In fact, expression of the Soloist gene was detected only in the bud of Chinese cabbage plants. The ERF subfamily, which plays significant roles in regulating gene expression in response to biotic and abiotic stresses, was the most abundant class of the AP2/ERF family differentially expressed in response to drought (Figure S4).The bZIP TF family, which contain a basic region for DNA-binding and a leucine zipper motif for dimerization, is one of the largest and most diverse TF families in plants, and plays diverse functions in plant growth and development and environmental stress responses, especially in ABA signaling related to stress responses. Out of 136 bZIP TFs identified in B. rapa (BrbZIP), 132 bZIP TFs were found in Chinese cabbage transcriptome libraries, and exhibited differential expression patterns (Figure 3A). Among them, 64 bZIP TFs were mainly differentially expressed in drought-treated plants. A total of 17 bZIP TFs were increased in both leaves and roots of drought-treated plants, and five bZIP TFs were only up-regulated in leaves. In addition, seven bZIP TFs were only down-regulated in leaves, six bZIP TFs only in roots, and three bZIP TFs were down-regulated in both roots and leaves. Drought stress-responsive gene expression is regulated by TFs operating in ABA-dependent and ABA-independent signaling pathways. Among these TFs, members of the bZIP TF family regulate the transcriptional induction of genes directly or indirectly linked with stress tolerance in plants. In Arabidopsis, accumulated evidence has suggested that group-A bZIP including AtbZIP35, AtbZIP36, AtbZIP37, AtbZIP38, AtbZIP39, AtbZIP40, and AtbZIP66 play crucial roles in activating plant ABA signaling or in abiotic stress response. We also found that BrbZIP23 (XP_009112062.1), BrbZIP15 (XP_009101738.1), BrbZIP17 (XP_009123528.1), BrbZIP21 (XP_009135624.1), BrbZIP22 (XP_009145807.1), and BrbZIP10 (XP_009104023.1), belonging to group-A BrbZIPs, were involved in drought response (Figure 3B). In addition, BrbZIP101 (XP_009111876.1), BrbZIP114 (XP_009138305.1), and BrbZIP115 (XP_009111076.1), belonging to group-S bZIPs, were also found to be induced under drought conditions. Although the physiological function of group-S bZIPs remains poorly understood, the increased transcription levels of group-S bZIPs due to abiotic stresses might suggest their regulatory roles in stress response in plants. Further, poplar PtabZIP1-like (PtabZIP1L), homologous to the Arabidopsis bZIP1 belonging to group-S bZIPs, has been known to be a positive modulator of drought resistance acting through modulation of multiple metabolic pathways including flavonoid biosynthesis. These findings indicate that drought-induced group-S BrbZIPs (Figure 3C) might be interesting candidate genes for improving drought tolerance.To validate the gene expression results from RNA-seq, the expression of nine bZIP TFs up-regulated in both roots and leaves was analyzed using qRT-PCR. As shown in Figure 3B, the expression pattern of these genes was found to vary in response to drought. In addition, exposure of Chinese cabbage to NaCl or wounding also significantly induced or repressed the expression of these genes, although the changes were relatively lower than those due to drought treatment (Figure S5). Further, selected bZIP TFs were found to show complex expression patterns in response to drought, NaCl, and wounding, as evidenced by cluster analysis results represented as a heatmap (Figure 3C). In cluster I, BrbZIP (XP_009111876.1), also known as BrbZIP101 exhibited relative higher transcript accumulation in drought-treated leaves and was transiently down-regulated in response to NaCl and wounding stresses, whereas BrbZIPs in cluster II only showed transient down-regulation due to wounding stress. These results indicate that BrbZIPs have divergent functions in response to environmental stresses, and the increased expression of BrbZIP101 might suggest its role as a marker of drought-stress response.Functional enrichment analysis with respect to known gene ontologies using MapMan can be performed to obtain a global overview of high-throughput data in the context of metabolic pathways and biological processes. To investigate the metabolic pathways affected by drought stress, MapMan analysis was performed on L2/L1, L3/L1, R2/R1, and R3/R1 comparisons based on DEGs. In leaves and roots of drought-treated plants, several metabolic pathways including those involving cell wall synthesis, light reactions, and the Calvin cycle were found to be down-regulated, whereas those involving fermentation, starch synthesis, and amino acid synthesis were up-regulated (Figure 4). However, the impact of drought stress on the transcript levels of genes involved in these metabolic pathways in roots was higher than that in leaves. Noticeably, the genes involved in the sulfur-containing secondary metabolites (S-misc) category pathways were up-regulated in the leaves but down-regulated in the roots under drought-stress conditions, indicating differences between organs of Chinese cabbage in response to drought stress.2.4. Alteration in Glucosinolate Metabolism in Rresponse to Drought StressIn higher plants, a variety of sulfur-containing secondary metabolites are synthesized, which often play a crucial role in the survival of plants under biotic and abiotic stresses. The alteration in sulfur metabolism under drought conditions is consistent with the promotion of root growth. The down-regulation of glucosinolate metabolism in roots upon drought suggests a switch in sulfur metabolism from glucosinolate to other metabolic processes, which are required for enhancing root growth. Interestingly, we found that the genes involved in sulfur-containing secondary metabolites have opposing expression patterns in leaves and roots during response to drought stress (Figure 4). With respect to the S-misc BIN category, the genes mainly represented were those responsible for glucosinolate biosynthesis including branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase 4 (BCAT4) and methylthioalkylmalate synthase 1 (MAMI1) (Figure S6, Table S2). To test whether the increased expression of these genes correlated with the accumulation of glucosinolates, we analyzed drought-induced variation in glucosinolate composition and content. As shown in Figure 5, the total glucosinolate content was increased in response to drought stress in leaves of Chinese cabbage, suggesting that the accumulation of glucosinolates in L3 was due to increase transcription of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes.In addition, variation in the levels of identified glucosinolate compounds between non-stressed plants (L1) and drought-treated plants (L3) was observed. The compound 4-methoxyglucobrassicin (0.73 +- 0.01 nmol/mg of D.W) was found to be the major constituent in Chinese cabbage cultivars (Chunkwang), followed by progoitrin (0.55 +- 0.01 nmol/mg of D.W) and glucobrassicin (0.42 +- 0.001 nmol/mg of D.W), whereas glucobrassicanapin (1.50 +- 0.02 nmol/mg of D.W) and 4-methoxyglucobrassicin (1.02 +- 0.002 nmol/mg of D.W) were the abundant glucosinolates in L3. Further, drought-stress treatment led to an approximately six-fold increase in levels of gluconapin and 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin, indicating that drought stress increased the transcription level of genes involved in the glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway (Figure S6) and glucosinolate accumulation in the leaves of Chinese cabbage (Figure 5), consistent with the protein competition model which predicts the effects of environmental factors on secondary metabolism. Similarly, the accumulation of glucosinolates has been observed in Brassica species as a part of the plant's response to drought, although this response was highly variable depending on the duration and intensity of drought. These findings indicate that drought stress significantly influenced the glucosinolate composition and content through modulating the expression of a range of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes.Glucosinolate degradation products generated by the enzymatic action of myrosinases have attracted attention for several years due to their important role in plant defense against pests and pathogens. In addition, the multiple roles of glucosinolates and their degradation products in heat tolerance, water transport, and transcriptional reprogramming suggest the physiological importance of these compounds in plant response to environmental stresses. Exogenous application of glucosinolate degradation products, isothiocyanates, nitriles, and thiocyanates has been found to induce stomatal closure, allowing suppression of water loss. Here, we hypothesized that drought-induced accumulation of glucosinolates may regulate stomatal closure leading to suppression of water loss. To test this hypothesis, glucosinolate-derived products were extracted from L1 and L3 samples and were applied to leaf disks floated on the opening medium. Application of glucosinolate-derived products significantly reduced stomatal apertures compared with application of mock-control (solvent control) (Figure 6).The movement of the stomatal guard cells was found to be more responsive to glucosinolate-derived products obtained from L3 than to those obtained from L1 (Figure 6), indicating that the accumulation of glucosinolates induced drought tolerance through stimulating stomatal closure. Taken together, the increased concentration of sulfate transported from the roots to the leaves might be required for enhancing the anti-transpiration effect of ABA in the stomata in leaves, and glucosinolate degradation products function analogously to ABA in stomatal aperture regulation. These findings suggest that sulfur metabolism plays significant roles in drought stress signaling and responses and indicate that variation in glucosinolate metabolism between roots and leaves (Figure 5) is required for successful defense against drought conditions."}, "11798435": {"doi": "10.1098/rspb.2001.1861"}, "26946249": {"doi": "10.1093/nutrit/nuv110"}, "27085186": {"doi": "10.1093/jxb/erw147", "title": "Quantitative proteomics reveals the importance of nitrogen source to control glucosinolate metabolism in Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica oleracea ", "abstract": "HighlightA quantitative proteomic approach demonstrates how ammonium nutrition induces glucosinolate biosynthetic and catabolic pathways in Arabidopsis and broccoli.Accessing different nitrogen (N) sources involves a profound adaptation of plant metabolism. In this study, a quantitative proteomic approach was used to further understand how the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana adjusts to different N sources when grown exclusively under nitrate or ammonium nutrition. Proteome data evidenced that glucosinolate metabolism was differentially regulated by the N source and that both TGG1 and TGG2 myrosinases were more abundant under ammonium nutrition, which is generally considered to be a stressful situation. Moreover, Arabidopsis plants displayed glucosinolate accumulation and induced myrosinase activity under ammonium nutrition. Interestingly, these results were also confirmed in the economically important crop broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica). Moreover, these metabolic changes were correlated in Arabidopsis with the differential expression of genes from the aliphatic glucosinolate metabolic pathway. This study underlines the importance of nitrogen nutrition and the potential of using ammonium as the N source in order to stimulate glucosinolate metabolism, which may have important applications not only in terms of reducing pesticide use, but also for increasing plants' nutritional value.", "intro": "IntroductionWith the exception of nitrogen-fixing legumes, plants obtain the nitrogen (N) they need for their growth and development from soil. Nitrogen can be found in organic and inorganic compounds; the main available inorganic N forms are nitrate (NO3 -) and ammonium (NH4 +). The proportion of each depends on environmental factors, including the soil's physical and chemical characteristics (e.g. pH or organic matter content), soil nitrification versus ammonification rates, and soil use. Agricultural soils are often N deficient and need to be supplemented with extra N. Ammonium-based fertilizers formulated with nitrification inhibitors are commonly used to maintain the N available in the soil for longer periods, meaning crops can grow for several weeks with ammonium as the main N source. It is known that the N source influences plant nutrient uptake, cell metabolic homeostasis, and signalling pathways. Indeed, the N source may strongly determine plant response to environmental alterations, both biotic and abiotic. All species display a different N source preference; however, assigning this preference is a difficult task because it depends on a complex interaction between genetic, environmental, and ecological factors and there is no robust classification. Although ammonium stress is a general phenomenon, it presents extremely variable inter- and intraspecies thresholds before signs of its impact appear. Arabidopsis thaliana, and the Brassicaceae family generally, have been described as being sensitive towards ammonium nutrition.Based on physiological studies of the primary metabolism in plants, different strategies have been described to avoid ammonium stress; inter alia, NH4 +/NH3 extrusion, ammonium compartmentalization, or increasing ammonium assimilation. Launching and maintaining these processes is highly energy-demanding and often results in the most apparent symptom of ammonium toxicity, growth impairment. Ammonium sensitivity can also be mitigated through the modulation of external conditions, for example by controlling external pH, by avoiding low potassium concentrations in the nutrient media, by providing extra carbon/energy, or by supplying minimal amounts of nitrate together with ammonium. In general, the adjustment of primary metabolism towards ammonium nutrition has been studied extensively regarding both carbon and nitrogen metabolism. However, the investigation of the adaptation of secondary metabolism towards ammonium nutrition is still in its infancy. Different studies using Arabidopsis as a model have been useful to find new actors and pathways involved in ammonium stress, including genetic screenings of mutants and metabolome analysis of cell cultures grown with ammonium, but a proteome study does not yet exist.Glucosinolates are secondary metabolites derived from amino acids and constitute a group of plant thioglucosides (beta-thioglucoside-N hydroxysulfates) mainly found in the Brassicaceae family. There is great diversity in their structure; more than 140 different glucosinolates have been documented and there are at least 30 different glucosinolates in A. thaliana. At present, their function is mainly associated with the products of their degradation. Glucosinolates are degraded by specialized beta-thioglucoside hydrolases (TGGs, also called myrosinases) which release isothiocyanates that can then be converted into alternative products, such as thiocyanates, nitriles, or epithionitriles. The most extensively studied function of glucosinolates is related to the ability of cruciferous plants to defend against pathogen attack. Tissue damage, triggered for example by herbivores chewing, causes glucosinolates to breakdown into their degradation products, some of which have insect-deterring functions. More recently, their role in plant defence against microbial pathogens has also been described. Although less studied, glucosinolates also have an influence on other processes, such as K+ channel regulation and salt-stress response. Similarly, it has been suggested that they serve as a nutrient sink; for example, they may act as a sulfur sink, given that sulfur deprivation promotes glucosinolate degradation to assist in primary metabolism functions like protein synthesis.In this work, we aimed to better understand how plants adapt to different nitrogen sources and to increase our knowledge of how plants respond to ammonium nutrition. To this end, we grew A. thaliana plants in axenic hydroponic conditions with either nitrate or ammonium as the exclusive N source, and performed MS quantitative proteomics analysis. Finally, we determined whether the results found in the model plant Arabidopsis could be translated to an economically important Brassica crop, broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica).", "results": "ResultsArabidopsis physiology under a mild ammonium stressIn a previous study we grew A. thaliana plants under four different degrees of ammonium stress and observed that an external medium pH of 6.7 helped to alleviate ammonium stress. In the present work, we chose a pH of 6.7 and a 2mM ammonium concentration to further investigate Arabidopsis behaviour under a mild ammonium stress. In, plants were germinated and grown for 9 days prior to treatment onset with 0.5mM ammonium nitrate as the N source at a pH 5.9. However, in the present work, ammonium-fed plants were grown throughout the whole experiment without nitrate in the medium.Arabidopsis plants accumulated a similar biomass under both nutrition types (Table 1). However, shoot biomass was 10% lower and root biomass was 20% higher under ammonium nutrition, which meant the shoot to root ratio was greater in nitrate-fed plants (Table 1). As expected, the nitrate level was higher in nitrate-fed plants. In contrast, no ammonium, sulfate, or protein accumulated under ammonium nutrition. Chlorophyll accumulation or chlorosis have been shown to be markers of different ammonium stress degrees. In this work, the chlorophyll content was unaltered. However, the anthocyanin content was higher under ammonium nutrition, indicating that while the plants were generally tolerant towards the imposed treatment, they were actually facing a stressful situation (Table 1).Nitrogen source modulated Arabidopsis proteomeTo further understand how plants respond to long-term growth under ammonium nutrition, we carried out a quantitative proteome-wide study. To do so, we performed an iTRAQ 8-plex experiment, analysing four samples per treatment, with each sample corresponding to a pool of 100 plants. We identified 3760 proteins and, following the criteria described in the 'Materials and methods', we quantified 2108 proteins (Supplementary Dataset S1 contains the complete list of proteins identified, quantified, and differentially expressed; Supplementary Dataset S2 provides the information about all the peptides identified). Out of the quantified proteins, 144 were differentially expressed (fold-change ratios >= 1.5; P < 0.05), 75 were more abundant under ammonium nutrition, and 69 were more abundant under nitrate nutrition (Supplementary Dataset S1; Supplementary Fig. S2).In order to gain a more detailed description of the differentially expressed proteins we had identified, we used the BioMaps module of VirtualPlant 1.3 software to explore their distribution across gene ontology (GO) categories. Proteins were classified into cellular components using GO annotations of TAIR/TIGR and into functional categories using the GO annotations in the MIPS-FunCat (Fig. 1). With regard to cellular component classification, many of the differentially expressed proteins were associated with plastids, followed by those associated with the plasma membrane and the mitochondria (Fig. 1A). One could expect to find a predominant differential regulation of plastidic proteins because nitrite reduction takes place in this compartment; nevertheless, a similar number of proteins associated with plastids were found regardless of the nutrition type. Proteins associated with mitochondria or the vacuole mainly showed greater abundance under ammonium nutrition. By contrast, proteins classified within the cytosol, apoplast, or endoplasmic reticulum cellular components primarily showed increased content under nitrate nutrition (Fig. 1A). Therefore, these data suggest a differential cell compartment response for plants grown under different nitrogen sources.Classification into functional categories showed that most of the differentially regulated proteins were associated with metabolism, with a similar proportion of proteins in both nutritional regimes falling into this category (Fig. 1B). The largest differences in protein expression found between treatments were in the categories of 'transcription', 'cellular communication/signal transduction', 'protein synthesis', 'cellular transport', and 'protein with binding function', in which proteins with higher expression under nitrate nutrition predominated. However, the categories 'energy' and '(systemic) interaction with the environment' were predominantly composed of proteins whose expression was higher under ammonium nutrition (Fig. 1B).Overrepresentation of GO Biological Process was also analysed by the BioMaps module of VirtualPlant 1.3 using the A. thaliana TAIR 10 genome as a reference, Fisher's exact test, and a P value cut-off of P <= 0.01. This analysis was performed for all the differentially expressed proteins together (Supplementary Fig. S3) and also separately for the proteins more abundantly expressed under nitrate (Supplementary Fig. S4) or ammonium nutrition (Fig. 2). When all 144 differentially expressed proteins were included, GO enrichment analysis highlighted the change in carbon and nitrogen metabolism (Supplementary Fig. S3). The analysis with the 69 proteins with higher content under nitrate nutrition showed that, overall, amino acid metabolism and, more precisely, lysine metabolism biological processes were significantly enriched (Supplementary Fig. S4). Finally, the results obtained by analysing the 75 proteins identified with a higher content under ammonium nutrition also revealed that amino acid and carbon metabolism and, interestingly, glucosinolate catabolic processes were enriched (Fig. 2). Myrosinase 1 (TGG1, At5g26000) and Myrosinase 2 (TGG2, At5g25980), essential enzymes in glucosinolate catabolism, were more abundant under ammonium nutrition, with 2.1- and 2.2-fold higher levels, respectively (Supplementary Dataset S1).Glucosinolate metabolism is modulated by the nitrogen sourceIn order to complement and validate the iTRAQ-based LC-MS/MS analysis, western blotting assays were performed to check TGG1 and TGG2 levels. In agreement with iTRAQ results, TGG1 and TGG2 levels determined by western blotting were also higher under ammonium nutrition than nitrate nutrition. The densitometric quantification of the bands revealed very similar values to the ones obtained by proteomics for both TGG1 and TGG2 (Fig. 3A, B). Both TGG1 and TGG2 gene expression levels were also higher under ammonium nutrition, most notably TGG1, whose expression was twice what it was under nitrate nutrition (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, myrosinase activity values in plants grown under ammonium nutrition were twice those observed in nitrate-fed plants (Fig. 3D).To further investigate the glucosinolate metabolic pathway, we determined glucosinolate content by LC-MS. Ten different glucosinolates were detected in Arabidopsis leaves (Supplementary Table S1) but their accumulation levels allowed us to quantify only four of them (Fig. 4A). Of the four glucosinolates quantified, glucoraphanin (4MSOB, 4-methylsulfinylbutyl), 4-methoxyglucobrassicin (4MO3IM, 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl), and neoglucobrassicin (1MOI3M, 1-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl) accumulated under ammonium nutrition, whereas the level of glucobrassicin (I3M, indol-3-ylmethyl) was similar for both nutrition regimes (Fig. 4A). Glucoraphanin is an aliphatic glucosinolate derived from (homo)methionine whereas glucobrassicin and its 4-methoxy and 1-methoxy derivatives are indolic glucosinolates derived from tryptophan. Although there was evidence of glucosinolate accumulation, both methionine and tryptophan levels were similar between the two nutrition regimes (Fig. 4B). The expression of several cytochrome P450 genes involved in the glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway was also modulated by the nitrogen source. CYP79F1 and CYP79F2 from the aliphatic glucosinolate pathway showed greater expression levels under ammonium nutrition whereas CYP83A1 expression was not altered. In contrast, the expression of both CYP79B2 and CYP79B3, from the indolic glucosinolate pathway, was higher under nitrate nutrition whereas CYP83B1 and CYP81F2 expression was not affected by the nitrogen source (Fig. 4C).Broccoli plants under ammonium nutrition also revealed glucosinolate accumulation and myrosinase activationTo investigate whether the response observed in the model plant A. thaliana grown under axenic hydroponic conditions also occurs in an important Brassica crop species, we grew broccoli plants (cv. Monaco) in perlite and vermiculite under exclusively nitrate or ammonium nutrition at an N concentration of 5mM. This concentration was chosen to achieve a very mild ammonium stress similar to that experienced by Arabidopsis, in which plant biomass was not affected, while sufficient N was supplied for proper plant growth. Regarding plant biomass, as observed for Arabidopsis, plants grown at this ammonium concentration did not show signs of toxicity because the biomass accumulation was nearly equivalent when comparing both nutrition regimes (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, myrosinase activity was around 60% higher under ammonium nutrition (Fig. 5B). As observed in Arabidopsis, broccoli plants also accumulated glucosinolates (Fig. 5C). Thus, these data confirm that ammonium nutrition alters glucosinolate metabolism in not only Arabidopsis but also broccoli."}, "27783045": {"doi": "10.3390/molecules21101417", "title": "Exogenous Methyl Jasmonate and Salicylic Acid Induce Subspecies-Specific Patterns of Glucosinolate Accumulation and Gene Expression in Brassica oleracea L.", "abstract": "Glucosinolates have anti-carcinogenic properties. In the recent decades, the genetics of glucosinolate biosynthesis has been widely studied, however, the expression of specific genes involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis under exogenous phytohormone treatment has not been explored at the subspecies level in Brassica oleracea. Such data are vital for strategies aimed at selective exploitation of glucosinolate profiles. This study quantified the expression of 38 glucosinolate biosynthesis-related genes in three B. oleracea subspecies, namely cabbage, broccoli and kale, and catalogued associations between gene expression and increased contents of individual glucosinolates under methyl jasmonate (MeJA) and salicylic acid (SA) treatments. Glucosinolate accumulation and gene expression in response to phytohormone elicitation was subspecies specific. For instance, cabbage leaves showed enhanced accumulation of the aliphatic glucoiberin, progoitrin, sinigrin and indolic neoglucobrassicin under both MeJA and SA treatment. MeJA treatment induced strikingly higher accumulation of glucobrassicin (GBS) in cabbage and kale and of neoglucobrassicin (NGBS) in broccoli compared to controls. Notably higher expression of ST5a (Bol026200), CYP81F1 (Bol028913, Bol028914) and CYP81F4 genes was associated with significantly higher GBS accumulation under MeJA treatment compared to controls in all three subspecies. CYP81F4 genes, trans-activated by MYB34 genes, were expressed at remarkably high levels in all three subspecies under MeJA treatment, which also induced in higher indolic NGBS accumulation in all three subspecies. Remarkably higher expression of MYB28 (Bol036286), ST5b, ST5c, AOP2, FMOGS-OX5 (Bol031350) and GSL-OH (Bol033373) was associated with much higher contents of aliphatic glucosinolates in kale leaves compared to the other two subspecies. The genes expressed highly could be utilized in strategies to selectively increase glucosinolate compounds in B. oleracea subspecies. These results promote efforts to develop genotypes of B. oleracea and other species with enhanced levels of desired glucosinolates.", "intro": "1. IntroductionGlucosinolates are sulfur-rich secondary metabolites derived from amino acids and sugars that are biosynthesized in plant tissues. These molecules are widely produced in all oilseed and vegetable species of the order Brassicales, including Brassica oleracea. In fact, the hydrolysis of glucosinolates imparts characteristic flavors to Brassica vegetables. Myrosinase enzymes play the key role in hydrolysis of glucosinolates into bioactive and anti-carcinogenic products such as thiocyanates, isothiocyanates, nitrile and erucin. Glucosinolate compounds help prevent cancer cell production in animal tissues by controlling the cell cycle and accelerating apoptosis. Sulforaphane (an isothiocyanate) and indole-3-carbinol (a product of isothiocyanate) are strongly anti-carcinogenic, whereas phenethyl isothiocyanate plays an inhibitory role in the conversion of potential carcinogens from their native forms into carcinogenic forms. The products of glucosinolate hydrolysis can also induce important detoxifying enzymes, for example, glutathione S-transferase and quinone reductase (QR). QR catalyzes the conversion of toxic quinones into stable and non-toxic hydroquinones, reducing oxidative cycling, and the activation of QR has often been used as a biomarker for cancer prevention. The products of glucosinolate hydrolysis also up-regulate other health-promoting bioactivities including anti-inflammatory activity in B. oleracea. However, not all glucosinolate compounds play equivalent roles in human health and plant defense. For example, indolic glucobrassicin has the greatest antioxidative effect compared to other glucosinolates. Moreover, an anti-nutritional effect, e.g., goitrogenic effect (anti-thyroid activity) of progoitrin in ruminant animals is also reported.Elucidating the responses governing glucosinolate biosynthesis and accumulation with regard to exogenous factors is important in designing a strategy to produce Brassica vegetable varieties enriched in glucosinolates beneficial for human health and plant protection. A number of biotic and abiotic stresses increase the biosynthesis and accumulation of different types of glucosinolates in Brassica species. Exogenous application of jasmonic acid (JA) or salicylic acid (SA) is often used to mimic biotic stress. In notable number of studies, JA and SA applications have been shown to increase accumulation of beneficial biomolecules, including glucosinolates. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) can be utilized in fields for Brassica vegetable production to enhance human health-promoting glucosinolates and the market value of the products. Experimental evidence suggests that MeJA-induced glucosinolates enhance QR activity and, thus, play anti-carcinogenic roles. Exogenous MeJA has been reported to enhance particular indolic glucosinolates; for example, neoglucobrassicin significantly accumulated in the leaves of Brassica crops such as pak choi, cabbage, oilseed rape, broccoli, Chinese kale, oilseed mustard and turnip. By contrast, exogenous SA treatment has been reported to stimulate the biosynthesis and accumulation of all three types of glucosinolates: aromatic, indole, and aliphatic glucosinolates in Brassica crops. Pre-treatment with MeJA four days before harvest significantly improves the contents of desirable glucosinolates in kale, broccoli and cauliflower without decreasing postharvest quality. Accordingly, in our present study, we decided to apply MeJA and SA treatment four days before sampling to measure levels of aliphatic and indolic glucosinolates as well as the expression of genes involved in accumulation of glucosinolates.In the Brassicaceae family, glucosinolate biosynthesis is accomplished through a specially featured three steps process, namely: (i) elongation of the amino acid side chain; (ii) core structure formation; and (iii) secondary modifications of side chains. MYB-transcription factor related genes that trans-activate the functions of several genes are vital for side chain elongation and core-structure formation. A notable number of different gene loci are involved in secondary modifications of desulfo-glucosinolates to produce characteristically different glucosinolates, for example: ST5, GS-OX, GS-AOP, GS-OH are involved in aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis and CYP81, IGM are involved in indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis. It is therefore important to investigate which particular genes are involved in enhancing glucosinolates under exogenous phytohormone elicitation.B. oleracea is an important Brassica vegetable species that includes a number of commercially valuable subspecies, such as cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, kale, kohlrabi, and Brussels sprouts, among others. In B. oleracea, about 105 glucosinolate metabolism-related genes have been identified, including 22 catabolism-related genes. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR)-based expression profiling of 84 genes associated with glucosinolate transcription, biosynthesis and breakdown recently revealed that not all of the genes are expressed in the edible organs of various B. oleracea subspecies. However, expression patterns of glucosinolate biosynthetic genes after exposure to phytohormone elicitors has not been extensively explored in B. oleracea, although this information is needed for selective enhancement of healthful glucosinolate compounds. In this study, we have selected three economically important B. oleracea subspecies in Korea: cabbage, broccoli and kale.Here, we aimed to relate the expression of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes in three selected B. oleracea subspecies to their glucosinolate contents with or without MeJA and SA treatment. Identifying the genes that underlie the higher glucosinolate biosynthesis mediated by exogenous MeJA and SA at the subspecies level will open a window to generate novel commercial cultivars of B. oleracea with enhanced contents of desired glucosinolates.", "results": "2. Results2.1. Subspecies-Specific Effects of Exogenous MeJA or SA on Glucosinolate Biosynthesis Gene ExpressionWe carried out qPCR analysis of 38 glucosinolate biosynthesis-related genes from both aliphatic and indolic glucosinolate pathways (Figure 1). The results revealed that exogenous application of phytohormones affect the biosynthetic pathways in a variety-dependent manner. For example, the MYB28 gene Bol036743 was upregulated in broccoli leaves under MeJA treatment (p < 0.01, Figure 2A and Figure S1), whereas MYB28 genes Bol007795 in broccoli and Bol036286 in kale leaves were downregulated under both MeJA and SA treatment (p < 0.01 for both genes, Figure 2A and Figure S1). MYB51 genes Bol013207 and Bol030761 were upregulated in kale under SA treatment and MYB122 gene Bol026204 was upregulated in broccoli leaves under MeJA treatment (Figure 2B and Figure S1). Among the aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis-related genes, FMOGS-OX2 (Bol010993) and FMOGS-OX5 (Bol031350) were upregulated in cabbage leaves under MeJA treatment (Figure 2C and Figure S1). CYP81F1 gene Bol017375 was upregulated only in broccoli under both MeJA and SA treatment (Figure 2C and Figure S1). CYP81F4 genes Bol032712, Bol032714 and Bol028918 were downregulated under SA treatment in kale but upregulated in broccoli (Figure 2D and Figure S1). The more than 20-fold increase in expression of CYP81F3 gene Bol028919 in kale leaves under SA treatment was also remarkable (Figure S1). Broccoli was the most responsive to exogenous treatments in terms of the relative expression of both aliphatic and indolic transcription factor-related genes compared to cabbage and kale (Figure 2B and Figure S1).2.2. Subspecies-Independent Effects of Exogenous MeJA or SA on Glucosinolate Biosynthesis Gene ExpressionIn addition to subspecies-specific gene expression, some genes were upregulated in all three subspecies under MeJA or SA treatment. For example, MYB34 genes Bol017062 and Bol007760 were notable, as they alone out of six indolic transcription factor-related genes, were upregulated in all three subspecies under MeJA treatment (p < 0.01 for both genes, Figure 2B and Figure S1). The level of increase ranged between 2- and 16-fold (Figure 2B). The FMOGS-OX5 gene Bol029100 was downregulated in all three subspecies. The majority of the indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis genes were induced by either MeJA or SA treatment (Figure 2D and Figure S1). The level of expression of CYP81F4 genes Bol032712, Bol032714 and Bol028918 were remarkably high (376-, 50- and 2434-fold upregulated in broccoli, respectively) in all three subspecies under MeJA treatment (Figure 2D and Figure S1).2.3. Subspecies-Specific Glucosinolate Accumulation under MeJA or SA TreatmentHPLC analysis of leaves of the three subspecies detected eight different glucosinolates: five aliphatic glucosinolates, namely glucoiberin (GIB), progoitrin (PRO), glucoraphanin (GRA), sinigrin (SIN), and gluconapin (GNA), as well as three indolic glucosinolates: glucobrassicin (GBS), methoxyglucobrassicin (MGBS), and neoglucobrassicin (NGBS) (Table 1). Both MeJA and SA treatment increased the content of aliphatic GIB, PRO, SIN and indolic NGBS significantly in cabbage leaves (Table 1). SA treatment significantly increased the content of GNA in cabbage and that of GIB, GRA and MGBS in broccoli (Table 1). MeJA treatment significantly increased GBS in all three subspecies, SIN and NGBS in broccoli and NGBS in kale (Table 1). Notably, the content of all aliphatic glucosinolates in kale remained unaffected by exposure to exogenous MeJA or SA (Table 1). The content of GBS was 11-, 5- and 18-fold increased in cabbage, broccoli and kale leaves, respectively, under exogenous MeJA treatment compared to control plants (Table 1). The same treatment increased the content of NGBS by 4-, 158- and 19-fold in the cabbage, broccoli and kale leaves, respectively (Table 1). The SA treatment also increased the NGBS content by 4-fold in kale leaves (Table 1).2.4. Associations between Glucosinolate Contents and Gene Expression2.4.1. MYB34, ST5a and CYP81 Gene Expression Is Related to GBS and NGBS AccumulationPrincipal component analysis (PCA) indicated a probable association between indolic biosynthesis gene expression and glucosinolate contents (Table 2). PC2 coefficients explained 15% of the variation in the data, suggesting an association between higher GBS and NGBS contents and upregulation of ST5a (Bol026200), CYP81F1 (Bol028913), CYP81F1 (Bol028914), CYP81F4 (Bol032714), CYP81F4 (Bol028918) and downregulation of CYP81F2 (Bol026044) (Table 2). This PC accounted for significant treatment differences, where MeJA-treated samples had the largest and positive PC scores and both the control and SA-treated samples had negative PC scores (Table 2; see also Figure 2D). PC2 in the PCA between indolic glucosinolate content and expression level of indolic biosynthesis transcription factor genes also demonstrated an association between GBS content and MYB34 (Bol017062) expression with a significant treatment difference (Table S1). PC2 scores for that PC indicated that this variation is largely because of MeJA treatment (Table S1). PC1 and PC3, respectively explained 41.5% and 12.7% of the data variation between broccoli and the other two subspecies (Table 2). Exogenous MeJA treatment increased GBS most remarkably in cabbage and kale and NGBS in broccoli and that variation is largely explained by a negative relationship between GBS and NGBS content in PC3 (Table 1 and Table 2).2.4.2. CYP81F3 Gene Expression Is Related to MGBS Accumulation under SA TreatmentSimilar to NGBS, accumulation of MGBS was subspecies specific (Table 1). The cabbage leaves contained no detectable MGBS (Table 1). Exogenous SA increased the MGBS content in broccoli leaves compared to control plants (Table 1). PC5 indicated a positive relationship between MGBS content and upregulation of CYP81F3 genes in broccoli leaves under SA treatments (Table 2, Figure 2D).2.4.3. Expression of ST5c and FMOGS-OX5 Genes in Cabbage Is Related to Accumulation of Aliphatic GlucosinolatesWe observed enhanced biosynthesis of GIB and a few other aliphatic glucosinolates in cabbage under both MeJA and SA treatment (Table 1). The GIB and GRA contents had similar relationships to the expression of transcription factor-related and aliphatic biosynthesis genes (Tables S2 and S3). The higher content of GIB and other aliphatic glucosinolates was associated with variation in expression levels of ST5c (Bol030757) and FMOGS-OX5 genes in treated cabbage plants compared to controls (Figure 2C).2.5. Natural Variation in Glucosinolate Contents and Gene Expression2.5.1. Glucosinolate Accumulation and Gene Expression in Kale LeavesIn control plants, kale leaves had remarkably higher contents of PRO, SIN and GNA compared to cabbage and broccoli, revealing significant subspecies variation (Figure S3 and Table 3). Kale leaves also contained significantly more MGBS whereas cabbage leaves had higher contents of GIB and GRA (Figure S3). The PRO content in kale leaves was 13- and 72-fold higher compared to cabbage and broccoli leaves, respectively (Table 3). GNA content was 53-fold higher in kale leaves compared to cabbage (Table 3), whereas broccoli leaves contained no detectable GNA (Table 1). Among the aliphatic transcription factor-related genes, MYB28 (Bol036286) showed 93- and 253-fold higher expression in kale leaves compared to cabbage and broccoli (Table 3, Figure 3). The expression of ST5b, ST5c and AOP2 genes was 2.2- to 20.5-fold and 1.3- to 66-fold greater in kale than in cabbage and broccoli, respectively (Table 3). In addition, FMOGS-OX5 (Bol031350) and GSL-OH (Bol033373) were expressed 4.9- and 7.8-fold more highly in kale leaves compared to cabbage and broccoli, respectively (Table 3, Figure 3).2.5.2. Cabbage Leaves Have Higher GIB and GRA ContentsGIB and GRA were at the highest levels in cabbage leaves compared to broccoli and kale leaves (Table 3, Figure S3). In addition, MYB28 (Bol007795) had significantly higher expression in cabbage compared to broccoli and kale (Figure 3).Among the indolic glucosinolates, GBS was present at the highest levels in cabbage leaves, at 2.24- and 2.6-fold higher than in broccoli and kale, but no MGBS was detected in cabbage (Figure S3 and Table 4). Kale leaves had 17-fold more MGBS compared to broccoli, whereas the broccoli leaves contained 4.3- and 2.5-fold more NGBS compared to cabbage and kale, respectively (Figure S3 and Table 4). MYB34 (Bol007760, Bol036262), MYB51 (Bol013207) and MYB122 (Bol026204) showed more than two-fold higher expression in cabbage compared to the other two subspecies (Table 4). CYP81F4 (Bol032712) and CYP81F4 (Bol032714) had 2.7- and 316-fold higher transcript accumulation in cabbage compared to broccoli (Table 4). By contrast, ST5a, CYP81F2, CYP81F3, IGMT1 and IGMT2 showed higher expression in broccoli leaves compared to cabbage and kale (Table 4). CYP81F1 showed much higher relative expression in kale leaves compared to broccoli and cabbage (Table 4)."}, "23722664": {"doi": "10.3390/ijms140611607", "title": "The Physiological Importance of Glucosinolates on Plant Response to Abiotic Stress in Brassica", "abstract": "Glucosinolates, a class of secondary metabolites, mainly found in Brassicaceae, are affected by the changing environment.

IntroductionGlucosinolates, a class of secondary metabolites, are nitrogen- and sulfur-containing compounds mainly found in Capparales and almost exclusively in Brassicaceae, which include Brassica crops of economic and nutritional importance, as well as the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. Glucosinolates are chemically stable under normal conditions, but when plant tissues and cells are damaged, they are hydrolysed by the enzyme myrosinase, resulting in several degradation products, including isothiocyanates, nitriles, thiocyanates, epithionitriles and oxazolidines. Chemical factors, such as pH, availability of ferrous ions and the presence of myrosinase-interacting proteins, determine the final products. Among these products, special attention have been paid to isothiocyanates, because they are involved in plant defense against pathogens and herbivores, whereas in humans, the consumption of vegetables containing glucosinolates, such as broccoli, kale and Brussels sprouts, may confer protection against cancer. However, the physiological significance of glucosinolates and their degradation products in plants is not completely understood. Although the glucosinolate-myrosinase system is assumed to play a role in plant-herbivore and plant-pathogen interactions, several reports have considered glucosinolates as a sink for nutrients, like nitrogen and sulfur. However, when Brassica plants were exposed to excess sulfur amounts, the sink capacity of glucosinolates was limited.In numerous reports, the effect of abiotic stresses on the primary metabolic processes has been well documented (i.e., photosynthesis, growth and metabolism of antioxidants). However, environmental factors also influence secondary metabolism (Table 1). Generally, when plants are stressed, secondary metabolism may increase, because growth is often limited more than photosynthesis, and carbon fixation is predominantly invested to secondary metabolites production. However, although previous studies indicate that environmental factors, such as light, temperature salinity and drought, may modify glucosinolate composition, their physiological role in response to abiotic stress is not known.It has been reported that suppression of aliphatic glucosinolates by RNA interference (RNAi) in Arabidopsis plants provoked changes in protein and metabolites involved in physiological processes, such as photosynthesis, oxidative stress and hormone metabolism. These results reflected that pathways involved in physiological responses were closely connected to glucosinolate metabolism that can be also modifying by abiotic stress factors. In addition, understanding chemical changes in plants upon abiotic stress and the ecological implications for the plant-herbivore interactions is needed.In this review, the current status on the effect of different abiotic stresses on the production of glucosinolates is presented and discussed in the context of the recent results of their involvement in the abiotic-biotic stress interaction, as well as the plant response to environmental changes when glucosinolates are exogenously added. In addition, an update of the glucosinolate transport and allocation upon abiotic stress is reported.2. Changes in the Glucosinolate Profile under Abiotic Stress: Implications for Plant Adaptation2.1. SalinitySalinity can be considered as the major abiotic stress affecting plant physiology and, thus, plant development. One of the effects of salinity is the alteration of the secondary metabolism involving signal molecules, oxidative stress and intermediary reactions. The secondary metabolites, glucosinolates, have been shown to increase in plants when salinity stress is present above the tolerance levels. However, the different physiological stage of the plant or the level of tolerance to salinity and the individual glucosinolate response (in relation to glucosinolate-myrosinase system) needs a detailed analysis to discuss the response of glucosinolates to salt stress.Therefore, even though previous works evidenced that salinity (40 mM) highly increased the total glucosinolate content in broccoli inflorescences, these authors also observed that when the levels of salinity were high (80 mM), the increase in glucosinolates was reduced. These results could be related to the strong metabolism alteration focused in turgor adjusting and leading to a high growth reduction. The fact that glucosinolates were accumulated under low water potential when the leaves have to maintain turgor suggested that during salinity stress, the primary metabolism and growth were restricted, but not the secondary metabolism and the production of glucosinolates. It was suggested that the increase in glucosinolates was related to the synthesis of osmoprotective compounds.The variation in the amount and pattern of glucosinolates into the plant has been related to developmental stage. As a response to salinity, the increase of total glucosinolates was shown to be more pronounced in the florets than in the young fully expanded leaves, probably due to a higher de novo synthesis or the increased transport to this physiological sink via the phloem. The lack of an active metabolism for glucosinolate synthesis in the old leaves to a sink organ may explain the glucosinolate levels after the salt treatments. In another study, it was shown that a divergent composition of glucosinolates exists in different organs of the halophyte, Thellungiella, at different developmental stages of its lifecycle as a response to salinity, which reinforces the idea that glucosinolates could be synthesized de novo during the processes of growth.Glucosinolates degradation and turnover is carried out by the activity of myrosinases. Tissue damage brings myrosinase (cytoplasm) in active contact with glucosinolates (vacuole). However, the complexity of the regulation of the glucosinolate-myrosinase system has been pointed out, since no relationship has been observed between the glucosinolate level as a result of altered myrosinase activity in salinity stressed plants. In this study, an increase in glucosinolates degradation was expected to be observed as a consequence of membrane damage by salt stress indicated by high relative electrolyte leakage. Therefore, the lack of relation between myrosinase activity and glucosinolate levels supported the hypothesis that salinity results in an alteration of metabolic activity producing an increase in glucosinolate content.It has been also reported that salinity stress response may show lifelong latency in the way in which a plant allocates resources to growth, defense and reproduction. Therefore, as salinity stress affects the priorities of the plant in all the stages of its lifecycle, changes in glucosinolates synthesis as a result of cellular signaling could be observed. However, the fact that glucosinolates act as signals themselves can also be considered.Therefore, the mechanism of glucosinolate turnover regulation under salinity still is not completely clarified. The effect of salinity on biosynthesis and metabolism on individual glucosinolate merits further investigations. Furthermore, the function of glucosinolates under a salinity stress situation, further than in defense switching, in terms of alleviating the pathogens attack, deserves more attention.2.2. DroughtWater stress increased the glucosinolate accumulation in Brassica species:Nasturtium officinale L.; Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata; Brassica oleracea L. var. italica; Brassica napus L.; Brassica rapa ssp. rapifera L.; and Brassica carinata L. :in agreement with the prediction of \"protein competition model\", where drought is expected to reduce some vegetative growth parameters with the subsequent increase of secondary metabolites at the expense of primary metabolism.Although the induction of glucosinolates accumulation by drought conditions has been reported as part of the plant response to stress through the process of osmotic adjustment, contradictory results have been observed in the literature when high drought (30% of the amount of water received by well-watered plants) had no effect on the concentration of total glucosinolates in Brassica oleracea L. var. gemmifera (Brussels sprouts) or in Brassica napus L. under mild drought stress, whereas water deprivation produced significant glucosinolate reductions in Brassica oleracea and in the rosette leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana L.. Therefore, the intensity and duration of drought appear to be an important factor in the accumulation of each specific glucosinolate, as well as the developmental stage of the plant when the stress is applied.On the other hand, it is known that plant-pathogens or plant-herbivores interactions that affect glucosinolates content may be influenced by stressful environments modifying the mechanisms of plant defense. Therefore, several studies have been focused on the interaction between drought stress and herbivore damage to elucidate the involvement of phytochemicals in this response and its ecological implications. In Brassica oleracea, Gutbrodt et al. showed that two lepidopteran herbivores preferred drought-stressed plants to the well-watered, although glucosinolate concentrations did not change. These authors suggested that other compounds involved in the drought stress-response may regulate feeding preferences. Khan et al. studied the interaction of different water regimes and two aphid pest species (Brevicoryne brassicae and Myzus persicae) in broccoli. The plant response with enhanced glucosinolate content after feeding by Myzus persicae depended on plant water availability, whereas the plant response to Brevicoryne brassicae, with increasing glucosinolate levels, was independent of the water status. Similar results were found in Arabidopsis plants, where M. persicae damage reduced the accumulation of glucosinolates in most water treatments, with the downregulation of the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway.In Brussels sprouts, glucosinolate levels increased 62% under the combination of drought stress and root herbivory and were positively correlated with the aphid development time, which probably varied, due to the altered relative water content (turgor pressure) of the plant under drought. However, the effect of environmental conditions on herbivore-plant interactions was dependent on the level of stress, and the response to stress intensity is not always linear.In recent reviews, the importance of the abiotic-biotic stress interaction has been highlighted. In the response to water stress, abscisic acid (ABA) plays a definitive role promoting adaptations, such as stomatal closure. The antagonistic effect of ABA, JA and ethylene (ET) on defense response against plant-pathogens is well known. Thus, the inhibition of disease resistance induced by ABA would be the reason of pathogen preferences for water-stressed plants. However, recent results showed that the expression of biotic stress markers that are involved in indole glucosinolate biosynthesis were significantly higher in the leaves of well-watered Arabidopsis plants than in plants grown under mild water deficit (40% reduced soil water content), whereas no significant differences were found in the expression levels of genes involved in hormone and signaling response to drought stress, such as ABA and ET, under both set of conditions. These results pointed to the complexity of the response to the abiotic and biotic stress interaction.Also, it has been proposed that abiotic stress may increase the delivery of glucosinolates from the vacuole to the cytosol in leaf cells of Arabidopsis thaliana or enhance the activity of myrosinase or its substrate affinity in such a way that the hydrolysis products of the glucosinolates (their cognate isothiocyanates) could lead to the inhibition of inward K+ channels in the guard cells to avoid water loss by stomatal closure. According to this, a recent report showed that the application of exogenous allyl-isothiocyanate to the leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana induced stomatal closure, leading to the suppression of water loss and preventing the possibility of fungal invasion.Beattie reported some of the genes affected by the crosstalk of both abiotic and biotic signaling pathways, indicating some of the proteins that have been identified as possible components of both pathways. This author underlined how the control of water movement could be a mechanism for pathogen restriction. In this sense, the involvement of the membrane water channels or aquaporins is suggested.Furthermore, recently, CML42, a calmodulin-like protein, has been identified as a protein that coordinates both herbivory and abiotic stress responses in Arabidopsis. In the proposed model for the roles of CML42, it was suggested that the protein acts as a negative regulator of plant defense against Spodoptera littoralis by ABA accumulation under drought stress and increased aliphatic glucosinolate levels among others signaling mechanisms.Finally, Siemens et al. suggested that glucosinolates may condition the processes that determine regional range boundaries for Boechera stricta, contributing to the restricted spatial distribution typical of most species of mustard. The authors proposed that the drought stress tolerance associated with range boundaries may compromise the defense evolution, and both pathways, ABA response and JA/ET signaling, together with the glucosinolate regulation are involved in the tradeoff and the development of species range limits.2.3. Extreme Temperatures and Light CyclingGlucosinolates content varies in response to temperature and light quality. The seasonal variation for the glucosinolate content in different Brassica sp., such as radish, oilseed rape, turnip and cabbage has been reported. In these studies, it was observed that spring season conditions, such as moderate temperatures, low humidity, high light intensity and longer photoperiods, induced higher glucosinolate accumulation than autumn/winter season conditions. Thus, elevated temperatures have been shown to increase glucosinolate levels in Brassica rapa, and a positive relationship between soil temperature and glucosinolates has also been documented in Brassica oleracea. However, Justen et al. observed some discrepancies with the results presented by Charron and Sams, referring these differences to distinct genotypes and growth environments. Thus, an interaction between temperature, solar radiation or plastic mulch properties may condition glucosinolate content in greenhouse or field experiments. Also, it must be considered that, in general, indole glucosinolates are more sensitive to elevated temperatures than aliphatic or aromatic glucosinolates. Therefore, the contribution of each individual and specific glucosinolate to the variation of total glucosinolate levels by the temperature regime results in decisive importance.Rosa et al. observed that glucosinolate exhibited circadian rhythms varying during 24 h. This variation was more evident when the temperature was optimum for growth and development. However, at higher temperatures, glucosinolate changes were due to the effect of temperature rather than to the photoperiod. Thus, it has been evidenced that glucosinolate variation throughout the day follows similar patterns to other plant components in response to external factors. However, the results observed in Brassica oleracea where the glucosinolate levels decreased during the day and increased during the night were contradictory with those found in Arabidopsis where an enhanced accumulation of glucosinolates during the day was found in relation to the glucosinolate content in the night. Differences were attributed by the authors to the distinct developmental stage of the plants, as well as the main herbivores associated with both species, depending on their preferences for feeding during the day or by contrast if they were nocturnal insects.Also, Perez-Balibrea et al. demonstrated that broccoli sprouts growing under light conditions had higher total glucosinolates content than those grown in darkness, but different results were found concerning the effect of light intensity and quality on glucosinolate concentrations depending on plant genotype, as well as the particular glucosinolate.In several reports have been determined the transcription factors involved in the glucosinolate modulation by the temperature and the cycling light. Recently, in Brassica rapa, some MYB transcription factors have been identified as responsible for glucosinolate accumulation under elevated temperature. Similar regulation of the aliphatic glucosinolate transcripts levels by the light was observed in plants with modulated expression of MYB factors. However, the aliphatic and indolic MYB factors have been shown to be regulated differentially in Arabidopsis plants by the light cycling, and thus, the transcription factor HY5 acts as a repressor of the aliphatic MYB factors and as an activator of indolic MYB factors, being at the same time involved in the sulfate assimilation. This fact pointed out the co-regulated coordination of glucosinolates and sulfur metabolism by the cycling light. The interconnectivity between metabolism and the circadian rhythm to optimize carbon allocation has been suggested in a recent review, where it has been pointed out that the gene, AOP2, codifies a biosynthetic glucosinolate enzyme that controls glucosinolate conversion into another, altering circadian clock regulation. In addition, discrepancies between the glucosinolates content and the expression level of the genes involved in their synthesis during the photoperiod indicated that the regulation of glucosinolates biosynthesis was not only due to gene expression, but also, the glucosinolate turnover exerted influence.It has been shown that an Arabidopsis mutant deficient in glucosinolate metabolism presented reduced levels of the heat-shock stress protein, Hsp90, and less tolerance to elevated temperatures. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the exogenous addition of two isothiocyanates, phenethyl- and allyl-isothiocyanates, enhanced heat tolerance in Arabidopsis plants by increasing the expression level of heat shock proteins and H2O2 accumulation. It was determined that the mode of action of phenethyl-isothiocyanate (PEITC) was similar to salicylic acid (SA), a heat tolerance inducer that inhibits the catalase activity in plants and produces the H2O2 accumulation, but the molecular mechanisms behind the recognition of both compounds may be different and worth study.Therefore, glucosinolates and their hydrolysis products, the isothiocyanates, may induce heat tolerance by modulating the plant physiological status in a similar way to stress-acclimating processes. An additional function of glucosinolates and isothiocyanates in the physiological responses of plants to high temperatures could be proposed, in addition, to the well-known defense function against pathogens.2.4. Nutritional DeficienciesIdentification of standard nutritional requirements of Brassica crops is particularly important, due to the impact of providing added-value plants products with superior health-promoting benefits. As glucosinolates are nitrogen (N)- and sulfur (S)-containing plant secondary metabolites, S and N supply and the right balance between N:S have a clear effect on their concentration in Brassica plants.Brassicaceae requires relatively large amounts of N for optimum growth and production of high quality inflorescences. The amount of N found to give optimal yield varies greatly, due to soil properties, climatic conditions and product requirements. However, excessive or low amounts of N supply may cause some physiological disorders, like hollow stem, and some pathological problems that may alter glucosinolates concentration. Excess N usually produces a decrease in total glucosinolates. However, opposite of what can be thought, some studies showed that broccoli plants grown with an insufficient N supply showed an increase in total glucosinolates if S fertilization is not limiting. This has been discussed by the high coordination of both N and S assimilatory pathways; the deficiency of one element represses the other pathway. When S is limited, O-acetyl serine can accumulate, whereas if N is limited, the increase of O-acetyl serine is inhibited. The effect of both O-acetyl serine and reduced S compounds have been shown to act antagonistically. Therefore, low S supply combined with optimal N fertilization could thus lead to accumulation of O-acetyl serine and reduced cysteine synthesis, resulting in a lack of precursors for glucosinolate synthesis.Also, different responses have been described according to the specific glucosinolate. N fertilization had a significant impact on the content of aliphatic or indolic glucosinolates in Eruca sativa L.. While aliphatic glucosinolates responded negatively to N fertilization, indole glucosinolates showed a positive response. However, in other studies, high rates of N (120 or 240 kg/ha) application resulted in an increase of the aliphatic glucoraphanin and the indolics, glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin. These differences have been discussed in terms of the effects of N on biomass production and its consequences for glucosinolates biosynthesis.An increased S supply has been shown to result in higher levels of total glucosinolates in Brassica rapa and of individual glucosinolates, such as glucoraphanin and glucoraphasatin, sinigrin, glucobrassicanapin, gluconapin and progoitrin in Brassica juncea L.. Interestingly, other works showed no significant differences in total glucosinolates, aliphatic or indolic glucosinolates in different cultivars and breeding lines between poor (15 kg/ha) and very high (150 kg/ha) S fertilization when the rest of conditions were optimal. These results highlighted the relevance of N stress versus S stress in relation to glucosinolates metabolism and revealed that S nutritional stress leads to glucosinolate synthesis alteration.Potassium (K+) deficiency has been shown to increase oxylipins and glucosinolates levels in Arabidopsis plants. These authors showed higher levels of glucosinolates in the roots compared to the shoots, the root glucosinolates being little affected by K deficiency. A differential function for glucosinolates in the roots and shoots was proposed, as well as a restricted role of jasmonic acid (JA)-signaling in the shoot, mediating glucosinolate synthesis after the K deficiency. Similarities with the induced JA pathway by herbivores may suggest the role of glucosinolates to enhance plant defense ability under K starvation. However, in another report, an early induced K deficiency reduced plant growth and reproduction, as well as decreased the glucosinolates content in the seeds of Brassica rapa. The contradictory results showed the plasticity of plant response to sustained or short-term K deficiency and should be taken into account for further investigation on glucosinolate production and enrichment.The effect of micronutrient stress has been related to glucosinolates synthesis. In this sense, selenium (Se) fertilization has been related with S nutrition in the study of its effect on the synthesis of glucosinolates. Kim et al. observed a high accumulation of Se in all varieties with increased glucosinolates concentration in only some of the studied cultivars via MeJA-pathway mediated indolic glucosinolate accumulation in broccoli. Also, in former papers, boron deficiency has been related to the increase of indolic glucosinolates, suggesting that the increase of the flux through the oxidative pentose phosphate and shikimic acid pathways led from tryptophan to accumulated glucosinolates.3. Glucosinolate Organ or Tissue Allocation and Transport under Abiotic StressPlant resistance to abiotic and biotic stress involves an optimized allocation of resources, as well as direct protection of plant tissues by secondary metabolites. In this way, glucosinolates are usually present in all parts of the plant, but concentration is already variable, depending on the different plant tissues and developmental stages under normal situations. Generally, the highest levels of glucosinolates were found in young leaves and reproductive tissues, such as siliques and seeds, whereas the glucosinolate content declined in mature leaves. However, in a recent review based on the determination of glucosinolate content in the roots and shoots of 29 plant species, it has been documented that roots have higher concentrations and diversity of glucosinolates than shoots. Whereas the biotic factors that influence glucosinolate allocation have been widely studied, less is known concerning the distribution and transport of glucosinolates under abiotic stress. In fact, there are only a few studies concerning the relation between the variation of shoot and root glucosinolate profiles and concentration and the different environments where plants grow.Abiotic stressors, such as salinity, drought, nutrient deficiency and acidity, may change defense allocation patterns in Brassica rapa. Thus, the concentration of gluconapin, was significantly higher in leaves and seeds of acidity-treated plants and significantly lower in seeds of nutrient-deficient plants. The results were in agreement with previous reports, where the early response of glucosinolates to nutrient deficiency was studied in different tissues. Therefore, the lower availability of nutrients, especially N and S as glucosinolate precursors, may alter glucosinolate tissue allocation. Thus, plants may catabolize their glucosinolates and use the released sulfur to assist primary metabolism, such as protein synthesis in a specific organ. In Arabidopsis, this loss of glucosinolates from old leaves has been attributed to catabolism or transport to other organs in response to sulfur demand.In aerial parts, the glucosinolate concentrations varied with different factors, including temperature, time of day, water content and nutrient supply. Under controlled conditions, the glucosinolate concentrations in the leaves of Brassica species oscillated when the plants were sown at different periods of time during several months, attributing these differences to abiotic seasonal changes.Soil properties, such as pH, may modify glucosinolate concentrations in the leaves of kale, pointing to a distinct distribution of each glucosinolate in the root or the shoot tissues.A direct allocation cost was assigned to glucosinolate production in Arabidopsis, with an increase of 15% in photosynthetic energy, to produce a set of 30 glucosinolates. This fact may justify the transient allocation and re-distribution of glucosinolates, suggesting a temporal and spatial transport of glucosinolates as the response to environmental changes. Therefore, as plants are unable to escape unfavorable environments, allocation of glucosinolates could be one strategy to cope with stressful conditions with relative low energy cost. However, the biological function of a particular glucosinolate in specific tissues requires more investigation."}, "22754334": {"doi": "10.3390/ijms13055832", "title": "Isolation and Expression of Glucosinolate Synthesis Genes CYP83A1 and CYP83B1 in Pak Choi (Brassica rapa L. ssp. chinensis var. communis (N.

IntroductionPak choi (Brassica rapa L. ssp. chinensis var. communis (N. Tsen & S.H. Lee) Hanelt) is a very important vegetable crop in China and Northeast Asia because of its high yield and nutritional value. It contains a number of bioactive components such as folates, vitamin C, carotenoids, polyphenols and glucosinolates which have anti-carcinogenic effects. Glucosinolates are a group of plant secondary metabolites derived from different kinds of amino acids and can be hydrolyzed by myrosinase to produce a variety of compounds which can have beneficial effects on human health including anti-carcinogenic, cholesterol-reducing and other pharmacological effects. The glucosinolates-myrosinase-system is also considered to be an efficient defense system for plant against herbivorous generalists and microorganisms.To date, more than 132 individual glucosinolates have been detected, and they are grouped into aliphatic, aromatic and indole glucosinolates depending on the structure of their side-chain. In recent years, significant advances have been made in our understanding of the biosynthetic pathway of glucosinolates. The formation of glucosinolates can be divided into three separate phases including the chain elongation, formation of the core structure and secondary modifications of side chain and glucose moiety of the parent glucosinolates. Since the completion of the Arabidopsis genome sequencing, a significant progress on glucosinolate research has been made especially in the identification of the genes and regulators for glucosinolate biosynthesis. MAM (Methylthioalkylmalate synthase) genes are responsible for the chain-elongation. CYP79 enzymes catalyze the first committed step of glucosinolates core structure formation as the conversion of amino acids to aldoximes. CYP83 enzymes catalyze the key step for the core structure formation as the conversion of aromatic oximes, and the conversion of thiohydroximic acids to glucosinolates.Of the two oxime-metabolizing enzymes CYP83A1 and CYP83B1, major progress has been made by using Arabidopsis as model plant. Aliphatic oximes derived from chain-elongated homologs of methionine are efficiently metabolized by CYP83A1 enzyme, whereas CYP83B1 enzyme metabolizes these substrates with very low efficiency. Aromatic oximes derived from phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are metabolized by both enzymes, although CYP83B1 has higher affinity for these substrates than CYP83A1. However, most of these researches are carried out in the model plant Arabidopsis. As glucosinolates have been proved to have many beneficial effects on human health and Arabidopsis is not edible, it is necessary to focus on glucosinolates-containing crops which are important for human consumption. In the present study, two glucosinolates biosynthesis genes BcCYP83A1 and BcCYP83B1 were isolated from pak choi and characterized and their expression pattern in different organs and cultivars were also characterized.", "results": "2. Results and Discussion2.1. Identification and Sequence Analysis of CYP83A1 and CYP83B1Two aliphatic oxime-metabolizing enzymes namely BcCYP83A1-1, BcCYP83A1-2, and one aromatic oxime-metabolizing enzyme BcCYP83B1 were isolated from the leaves of pak choi \"Hangzhou You Dong Er\" cultivar. The ORF of the genes were 1506, 1509 and 1500 bp in length, encoding 501, 502 and 499 amino acids, respectively (Figures 1 and 2). A BLAST search revealed that the primary structure of CYP83A1-1, CYP83A1-2 and CYP83B1 shared high sequence identity of 86.81, 87.43 and 90.13% to the corresponding ones in Arabidopsis (NM117451, NM119299), respectively, and shared high sequence identity of 99.14, 99.07 and 99.47% to the corresponding ones in Brassica pekinensis (Brassica rapa L. ssp. pekinensis var. communis, Chinese cabbage, FJ376049, FJ376050, FJ376051) respectively. The amino acid sequence deduced from CYP83A1-1 and CYP83A1-2 showed 87.65 and 86.48% identity to that of the Arabidopsis CYP83A1, and 98.80 and 98.61 % identity to Brassica pekinensis CYP83A1-1 and CYP83A1-2, respectively. The deduced amino acid sequence of CYP83B1 showed 95.59% and 98.80% identity to that of the Arabidopsis and Brassica pekinensis, respectively. The sequence similarity between CYP83A1-1 and CYP83A1-2 were 85.88% in this study, identical to that of 85.29% in Brassica pekinensis.2.2. Phylogenetic Analysis of CYP83A1 and CYP83B1We compared the isolated sequences with the corresponding ones in Arabidopsis thaliana (NM117451, NM119299) and Brassica pekinensis (FJ376049, FJ376050, FJ376051) by multiple alignments, and reconstructed the phylogenetic tree by ClustalW analysis program. The results showed that the homologs of CYP83A1 and CYP83B1 from the Brassicaceae family are highly conserved, with low variation in DNA sequence. As shown in the phylogenetic tree, the glucosinolate synthesis genes of Brassica chinensis and Brassica pekinensis clustered first with each other and then with the genes of Arabidopsis (Figure 3), which demonstrated the highly congruent relationship among different sources of glucosinolate synthesis genes.2.3. Expression of CYP83A1 and CYP83B1 in Different Cultivars and Various OrgansQuantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was employed to confirm the expression patterns of the two genes in seven cultivars, as well as in different organs. Actin was used as an internal reference control for total RNA input. In our analysis, the gene-specific primers used for amplification of CYP83A1 recognized and amplified both CYP83A1-1 and CYP83A1-2 genes. Both CYP83A1 and CYP83B1 were detected in the leaves of all the seven cultivars and had the same expression pattern except for cultivar \"ZYYDE\". The expression patterns of the two genes in leaves of seven cultivars are illustrated in Figure 4. CYP83A1 was presented in higher abundance compared with CYP83B1 in most of the cultivars, whereas the CYP83A1 and CYP83B1 transcripts in \"ZYYDE\" cultivar were nearly same.Both the aliphatic oxime-metabolizing enzyme and aromatic oxime-metabolizing enzyme were identified in the three organs (roots, leaves and petioles) of pak choi (cv. HZYDE). Though CYP83A1 and CYP83B1 exist in all those organs, they displayed spatial expression patterns (Figure 5). The expression level of CYP83A1 was higher in leaves than in roots or petioles, whereas the CYP83B1 showed higher mRNA abundance in roots compared with another two.2.4. Glucosinolate Profile Concentrations in Different Cultivars and Various OrgansThe concentrations of aliphatic, indole and aromatic glucosinolates in different pak choi cultivars and in different organs of \"Hangzhou You Dong Er\" cultivar were analyzed. As shown in Table 1, the aliphatic glucosinolate concentrations in leaves of most of the cultivars were higher than indole and aromatic glucosinolates. The glucosinolate profiles in different organs varied differently. As leaf and petiole had particularly higher aliphatic glucosinolates, however, root had much higher indole and aromatic glucosinolates.2.5. DiscussionIn this study, we isolated two CYP83A1 genes and one CYP83B1 gene from pak choi \"Hangzhou You Dong Er\" cultivar. Amino acid sequence analysis and sequence alignment with their homologs from Brassica pekinensis and Arabidopsis showed the two key glucosinolate synthetic genes CYP83A1 and CYP83B1 within Brassicaceae family are highly conserved. As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the genes isolated from pak choi have both high DNA and amino acid sequence conservation with their Brassica pekinensis counterparts. The identity of DNA sequence and deduced amino acid sequence of CYP83B1 between the two species was 99.47% and 98.80%. The two copies of CYP83A1 namely BcCYP83A1-1 and BcCYP83A1-2 from pak choi were also highly similar to the corresponding ones of Brassica pekinensis, whereas there was only one copy of CYP83A1 in Arabidopsis. This is consistent with the previous finding by Zang et al. that identities within Brassica rapa were usually higher than those with Arabidopsis. They isolated and analysed the glucosinolate synthesis genes in Brassica pekinensis by genome-wide identification. The result was also accordant to the notion that Brassica species evolved and were triplicated after divergence from Arabidopsis lineage. The observed glucosinolate synthesis sequence similarities among the Brassicas (mostly >90%) were higher than those between Brassica and Arabidopsis (mostly 80-90%) in this study also supported the presumptive evolution order.Consistent with the results of previous studies in Arabidopsis, both the CYP83B1 and CYP83A1 transcripts were expressed in all tested organs (roots, leaves and petioles) of pak choi. Mizutani reported that CYP83A1 expression levels in Arabidopsis was highest in leaves and significantly higher in roots and stems than in flowers and siliques, while CYP83B1 was the most highly expressed in roots. In our study, the expression level of CYP83A1 was also highest in leaves, and the CYP83B1 expressed higher in leaves and roots than in petioles. These results were consistent with the previous finding that CYP83A1 expressed highest in the leaves and CYP83B1 were preferentially expressed in the roots. The gene expression pattern in the organs was consistent with the glucosinolate profile accumulations as aliphatic glucosinolates were higher in leaves and petioles while indole and aromatic glucosinolates were higher in roots. The results were similar to Brown's finding that aliphatic glucosinolates are typically higher in the leaves compared to the roots while indole glucosinolates are abundant in the roots. When compared within an appointed organ, we found that the expression patterns of the two genes were different. CYP83A1 transcripts were almost two-folds of CYP83B1 transcripts in leaves and petioles, in contrast, the expression levels of the CYP83A1 were relatively lower than CYP83B1 in roots. Our finding was also accordant to the conclusion that the CYP83A1 catalyzed aliphatic glucosinolates biosynthesis and accumulation in leaves and the CYP83B1 catalyzed aromatic and indole glucosinolates mostly found in roots.The expression patterns of the two genes in leaves of seven cultivars in our study were similar except \"ZYYDE\" cultivar and the gene expression levels were consistent with the glucosinolate profile accumulation. The expression levels of CYP83A1 in leaves of six of seven cultivars were higher than CYP83B1 and the aliphatic glucosinolates of the six CYP83A1 higher expression cultivars were higher than another two glucosinolate profiles, whereas CYP83A1 and CYP83B1 expressed nearly identical in \"ZYYDE\" cultivar. While focused on the specific gene expression and glucosinolate accumulation in individual cultivar, \"SYM\" cultivar had high CYP83A1/CYP83B1 transcript level ratio and high aliphatic glucosinolates/indole glucosinolates ratio. And \"CGB\" cultivar had the higher CYP83B1 transcript level and relative higher aromatic glucosinolates accumulation."}, "24043856": {"doi": "10.1093/jxb/ert280", "title": "Four genes encoding MYB28, a major transcriptional regulator of the aliphatic glucosinolate pathway, are differentially expressed in the allopolyploid Brassica juncea ", "abstract": "Glucosinolates are Capparales-specific secondary metabolites that have immense potential in human health and agriculture. Unlike Arabidopsis thaliana, our knowledge about glucosinolate regulators in the Brassica crops is sparse. In the current study, four MYB28 homologues were identified (BjuMYB28-1,-2,-3,-4) from the polyploid Brassica juncea, and the effects of allopolyploidization on the divergence of gene sequence, structure, function, and expression were assessed. The deduced protein sequences of the four BjuMYB28 genes showed 76.1-83.1% identity with the Arabidopsis MYB28. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the four BjuMYB28 proteins have evolved via the hybridization and duplication processes forming the B. juncea genome (AABB) from B. rapa (AA) and B. nigra (BB), while retaining high levels of sequence conservation. Mutant complementation and over-expression studies in A. thaliana showed that all four BjuMYB28 genes encode functional MYB28 proteins and resulted in similar aliphatic glucosinolate composition and content. Detailed expression analysis using qRT-PCR assays and promoter-GUS lines revealed that the BjuMYB28 genes have both tissue- and cell-specific expression partitioning in B. juncea. The two B-genome origin BjuMYB28 genes had more abundant transcripts during the early stages of plant development than the A-genome origin genes. However, with the onset of the reproductive phase, expression levels of all four BjuMYB28 increased significantly, which may be necessary for producing and maintaining high amounts of aliphatic glucosinolates during the later stages of plant development. Taken together, our results suggest that the four MYB28 genes are differentially expressed and regulated in B. juncea to play discrete though overlapping roles in controlling aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis.", "intro": "IntroductionGlucosinolates are a diverse group of nitrogen- and sulphur-rich secondary metabolites characteristic of the order Capparales, which includes nutritionally important Brassica crops and the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Based on the precursor amino acid used, glucosinolates are broadly classified into three major groups namely aliphatic, indolic, and aromatic. The biosynthesis of glucosinolates can be divided into three phases: (i) recruitment of precursor amino acids and side-chain elongation, (ii) formation of the core glucosinolate structure, and (iii) side group modification. Together with side-chain elongation of the R-group, side-chain modifications generate a wide variety of glucosinolate compounds, with more than 200 structures identified to date.In recent years, glucosinolates and their breakdown products have been the subject of extensive studies due to their role in defence against pests and pathogens. Some glucosinolates and their breakdown products have anti-nutritional and goitrogenic properties in seed meal, while others act as anti-carcinogenic compounds in mammals. Due to their diverse roles in plant metabolism, animal nutrition, and disease, glucosinolates are a potential target for genetic manipulation in crop improvement programmes.Our understanding about the genes controlling the complex trait of glucosinolate accumulation has been obtained from various molecular-genetic and 'omics' based studies on the model plant A. thaliana. To date, more than 20 glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway genes have been identified in Arabidopsis. Recent reports have confirmed that glucosinolate levels are further controlled by at least six members of subgroup-12 of the R2R3-MYB superfamily. The Arabidopsis AtMYB28, AtMYB29, and AtMYB76 genes act as transcriptional regulators of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis, whereas AtMYB34, AtMYB51, and AtMYB122 specifically regulate indolic glucosinolate formation.The crops belonging to the genus Brassica have been of great economical importance to mankind because of their potential use as vegetables, oilseeds, feed, condiments, fodder, green manure, and even medical treatments. In Brassica crops, glucosinolate content and profiles are highly variable and species-specific, with aliphatic glucosinolates (derived from methionine) being the predominant glucosinolates (up to 95% of the total glucosinolates) in seeds. Over the past few decades, there have been ongoing breeding efforts towards the enrichment of beneficial aliphatic glucosinolates (e.g. glucoraphanin) and the reduction of anti-nutritional aliphatic glucosinolates (e.g. progotrin, gluconapin) in these crops. Genetic studies have shown that seed aliphatic glucosinolate content is a quantitative trait, controlled by a variable number of loci in both B. napus and B. juncea. Although these reports have identified few genomic regions (QTLs) that control the variability of glucosinolate contents and profiles across Brassica species, our understanding of the molecular-genetic mechanism controlling such an economically important trait in Brassica species is largely limited at present.Allopolyploidy is a condition in which a cell has two or more sets of chromosomes derived from two different species. For example, B. juncea (2n=4x=36) is an allotetraploid having a set of chromosomes derived from B. rapa (2n=2x=20) and a set from B. nigra (2n=2x=16). Because of the occurrence of polyploidy and genome-wide rearrangements, the regulation of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis in Brassica species is expected to be highly complex compared with that in the closely related diploid Arabidopsis. Comparative mapping studies between Brassica species and Arabidopsis revealed the triplicate nature of diploid Brassica genomes and strongly suggested that the extant diploid Brassica species have evolved from a common hexaploid ancestor at about 11-12 MYA. Further, genomes of the allotetraploid B. napus and B. juncea are even more complex and are known to retain up to six conserved segments/blocks of the ancestral genome. Thus, the existence of multiple homologues of each glucosinolate candidate gene in allotetraploid Brassica genomes is expected. Studies on the expression and functional variance of the homologous genes arising from polyploidy are therefore fundamentally important for a better understanding of the complex mechanisms controlling glucosinolate accumulation in these crops. Such an understanding would ultimately allow for the manipulation of specific genes for targeted engineering of glucosinolate accumulation without compromising overall plant fitness.To date none of the transcriptional regulators of aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis genes from any of the Brassica crops have been functionally characterized. The isolation of multiple MYB28 gene homologues from an economically important oilseed crop of the Brassica genus, B. juncea (AABB genome) as well as from genomes of its two progenitors namely, B. rapa (AA genome) and B. nigra (BB genome) is reported here. The consequence of polyploidy on gene structure, phylogeny, and gene expression and function has been investigated in detail. Taken together, our results highlight the importance of MYB28 homologues towards controlling complex glucosinolate traits in polyploid B. juncea, which could be utilized towards manipulating the pest resistance, anti-nutritional properties and health benefits of oilseed cultivars of this species.", "results": "ResultsIsolation of MYB28 homologues from B. juncea and its progenitor speciesDegenerate primers (see Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online) based on the reported sequence of A. thaliana AtMYB28 (At5g61420) protein were used to isolate partial cDNA sequences of MYB28 genes from B. juncea. A total of four partial MYB28-like sequences were isolated from this polyploid. Using a combination of 5' and 3' RACE strategy, four full-length BjuMYB28 sequences [designated as BjuMYB28-1 (Accession no. JQ666166), BjuMYB28-2 (JQ666167), BjuMYB28-3 (JQ666168), and BjuMYB28-4 (JQ666169)] were identified and confirmed with multiple amplifications from different tissue types (Table 1). The nucleotide sequences of these cDNAs showed 79.8-89.4% sequence identity in their coding regions (see Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online). The open reading frames of the four BjuMYB28 sequences varied from 1053-1095bp, encoding proteins of 351-365 amino acids.To determine the genomic structure of the four BjuMYB28 sequences, PCR amplification on total genomic DNA of B. juncea was performed using sequence-specific primers. The four genomic sequences varied in size, ranging from 1314-1630bp in length (Table 1; Accession nos. JQ700565-68). Comparison of the four BjuMYB28 cDNAs with their corresponding genomic sequences showed that all four genes consisted of two introns and three exons, with introns found to be more divergent in size and composition as compared to the coding regions (see Supplementary Fig. S2 and Supplementary Table S3 at JXB online). B. juncea is a natural allopolyploid species (AABB genome) formed from hybridization of B. rapa (AA genome) and B. nigra (BB genome). In order to assign the progenitor sub-genome to each BjuMYB28, MYB28 homologues from B. rapa and B. nigra were also isolated. Two MYB28 sequences could be isolated from both B. rapa (named as BraA.MYB28.1 and BraA.MYB28.2) and B. nigra (named as BniB.MYB28.1 and BniB.MYB28.2), representing the paralogous gene pair from each progenitor genome. Sequence analysis confirmed that two BjuMYB28 genes namely, BjuMYB28-1 and BjuMYB28-2 were similar to the B-genome paralogues (see Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online), and so will henceforth be referred to as BjuB.MYB28.1 and BjuB.MYB28.2, respectively (Table 1). Similarly, the nucleotide sequences of the remaining two B. juncea genes (BjuMYB28-3, and BjuMYB28-4) were highly similar to those of A-genome paralogues, and so will be referred to as BjuA.MYB28.1 and BjuA.MYB28.2, respectively. In general, the coding sequences of the MYB28 genes isolated from the species containing the progenitor A- and B-genomes showed very high levels of sequence identity (99.7-99.9%) with their corresponding MYB28 homologues from B. juncea (see Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online). Our data are in accordance with the reported allopolyploid origin of B. juncea, wherein both progenitor genomes have contributed a duplicated MYB28 gene pair (paralogues).Sequence analysis and phylogeny of BjuMYB28 proteinsIn order to investigate the evolutionary origin of the four BjuMYB28 genes further, an amino acid sequence alignment of the deduced BjuMYB28 proteins was created with the known MYB aliphatic glucosinolate regulators from A. thaliana. The biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolates in A. thaliana is regulated by three closely related members of subgroup-12 of the R2R3-MYB superfamily namely AtMYB28, AtMYB29 and AtMYB76. The deduced BjuMYB28 proteins shared maximum identity with the AtMYB28 protein (72.8-82.3%) among the three aliphatic glucosinolate regulators of Arabidopsis (Table 2). The deduced protein sequences of the four BjuMYB28 sequences were 74.9-86.6% identical with each other. Amino acid sequence alignment confirmed the presence of two imperfect sequence repeats (R2R3 repeat) at the N-terminal region (Fig. 1). Predicted signature sequences for both R2 (-W-X19-W-X19-W-) and R3 (-F-X18-W-X18-W-) repeats showed a high level of sequence conservation among BjuMYB28 proteins. In contrast to the highly conserved N-terminal DNA-binding MYB domains, the downstream C-terminal region of BjuMYB28 proteins showed homology only in patches (Fig. 1). The structural divergence of BjuMYB28 proteins might have consequences for their differential gene function(s) leading to loss or silencing, maintenance of ancestral function, or functional divergence either through sub-functionalization or neo-functionalization.The high level of amino acid identity and domain conservation indicated that the four BjuMYB28 proteins are closely related. Their evolutionary relationships vis-a-vis the MYB28 proteins isolated from the species containing the two progenitor genomes of B. juncea were compared with publicly reported MYB28-like sequences from other plant genomes. On a maximum likelihood tree, the four BjuMYB28 proteins were grouped together with the AtMYB28 protein into a distinct MYB28 sub-group with high bootstrap support; AtMYB29 along with AtMYB76 was found in a separate subgroup (Fig. 2). All four BjuMYB28 proteins shared a close evolutionary ancestry with MYB28-like sequences from Brassica species, particularly those obtained from the species containing the two progenitor genomes. For example, the B-genome-specific MYB28 proteins from B. juncea grouped with B. nigra proteins with very high bootstrap scores. Similarly, the A-genome specific MYB28 proteins of B. juncea grouped nicely with B. rapa sequences (including the recently reported sequences, Bra029311 and Bra012961). The phylogentic analysis thus clearly revealed that the four BjuMYB28 proteins are evolutionary conserved and have evolved via duplication (paralogues) and hybridization (homeologues) of two relatively simpler Brassica genomes, while retaining a very high level of sequence conservation following allo-polyplodization of A- and B-genomes. BjuMYB28 genes encode functional MYB28 proteins regulating the accumulation of aliphatic glucosinolatesBjuMYB28 proteins share a close evolutionary relationship to the Arabidopsis AtMYB28 protein, a member of R2R3-MYB transcription factor family. Although BjuMYB28 proteins lack the typical nuclear localization signal when queried using the PredictProtein software (), a conserved SV40-type putative nuclear localization motif (LKKRL) adjacent to the R3 repeat of these proteins was observed (Fig. 1). Thus, to investigate their subcellular localization, a representative BjuMYB28 protein (BjuMYB28-2) was selected and the Pro35S:BjuMYB28:YFP construct was introduced into onion epidermal cells by particle bombardment. The transiently transformed cells showed a strong yellow fluorescence signal in the nucleus, thus demonstrating that the BjuMYB28 are predominantly nuclear localized proteins, similar to what was observed for the Arabidopsis AtMYB28 protein (Fig. 3).In the absence of reverse genetics tools in the allopolyploid B. juncea, the functional contribution of each BjuMYB28 towards controlling the glucosinolate pool and profile was tested in the closest model system, A. thaliana. All four BjuMYB28 genes (under the control of the constitutive CaMV 35S promoter) were over-expressed in two different genetic backgrounds of A. thaliana, (i) the homozygous BRC_H161b, a myb28 knock-down T-DNA insertion mutant, and (ii) the wild-type (Col-0). Two independent homozygous lines of each BjuMYB28 were analysed for total as well as individual glucosinolate fractions in 4-week-old rosette leaves.The functional complementation of the BjuMYB28 genes elevated the accumulation of total aliphatic glucosinolates 1.6-2.2-fold compared with the mutant BRC_H161b line (Fig. 4A). Both short- and long-chain aliphatic glucosinolates were found to be elevated in these lines (Fig. 4B, C). The level of 4MSOB, the major glucosinolate present in Arabidopsis, was found to be increased by 1.7-2.2-fold. The content of other short-chain aliphatic glucosinolates, like 3MSOP and 5MSOP, was also found to be increased by up to 1.5-fold. Accumulation of the long-chain aliphatic glucosinolate 8MSOO was increased from 1.8-2.7-fold compared with the mutant line (Fig. 4C). The indolic glucosinolates (I3M, 1MOI3M and 4MOI3M) of complemented mutant lines were found to be unaltered in content (Fig. 4D). Thus mutant complementation analysis in A. thaliana clearly suggested that all four BjuMYB28 genes specifically regulate the aliphatic glucosinolate pools without altering the non-aliphatic glucosinolate levels.The functional divergence of BjuMYB28 genes in controlling the levels of aliphatic glucosinolate content and profile was assessed by generating over-expression lines for these homologues in the A. thaliana wild-type ecotype Col-0. Total, as well as individual, glucosinolate levels of two over-expression lines of each BjuMYB28 construct were analysed and compared with the wild-type control. As shown in Fig. 5A, BjuMYB28 over-expression provided an approximately 1.5-1.9-fold increase in leaf aliphatic glucosinolate accumulation compared with wild-type plants. Levels of 4MSOB, the major glucosinolate present in Arabidopsis, were found to be increased by 1.5-1.8-fold (Fig. 5B). Concomitantly, the level of 4MTB (precursor of 4MSOB), showed a significant reduction in over-expression lines for the two A-genome specific BjuMYB28 genes, thereby reflecting an increased flux of 4C-glucosinolate towards 4MSOB. The contents of short-chain aliphatic glucosinolates like 3MSOP and 5MSOP were also found to be increased up to 2.2- and 1.8-fold, respectively (Fig. 5C). Accumulation of long-chain aliphatic glucosinolates namely 6MSOH, 7MSOH, and 8MSOO, was also increased by 1.3-3.5-fold compared with the wild-type plants (Fig. 5D). Contents of indolic glucosinolates such as I3M, 1MOI3M, and 4MOI3M were found to be unaltered (see Supplementary Fig. S3 at JXB online).The increased glucosinolate accumulation in transgenic lines correlated with increased mRNA levels of the glucosinolate pathway genes of A. thaliana. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S4 at JXB online, the expression of genes involved in both side-chain elongation (MAM1, MAM3) and core biosynthetic steps (CYP79F1, CYP79F2, CYP83A1, AtST5b, AtST5c) of the aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway were considerably increased in both mutant complementation and over-expression lines compared with their respective backgrounds. The BjuMYB28 genes tested caused up-regulation of all the aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthetic genes tested, although at variable levels.Over-expression of BjuMYB28 genes in both wild-type and mutant backgrounds of Arabidopsis showed no visible effects on seed germination, plant growth or development. These lines grew normally and did not show any significant differences in response to different abiotic stress conditions (such as salt, heat, dehydration, cold) compared with their corresponding reference backgrounds (data not shown). Thus, both mutant complementation and over-expression studies clearly demonstrated that all four BjuMYB28 genes encode functional BjuMYB28 proteins regulating aliphatic glucosinolate pools.The four BjuMYB28 genes exhibit overlapping but distinct expression profiles in B. juncea Genome polyploidy events are often associated with variable expression of the homeologous gene pairs within the genome. The expression profiles of MYB28 genes were therefore analysed at different developmental stages of B. juncea as well as in progenitor species. The efficiency and specificity of gene-specific BjuMYB28 primer pairs was initially ascertained using a 10-fold serial dilution of the corresponding plasmid DNA. A linear correlation coefficient (R 2) of 0.99 and above was observed over a 100 000-fold dilution range, which reflected the high efficiency of each primer pair (see Supplementary Table S4 at JXB online). The expression profiles of MYB28 genes across various developmental stages (or tissue types) of the species representing the three Brassica genomes were compared with endogenous control genes.The expression profiles of MYB28 genes were investigated first in the progenitor species of B. juncea namely, B. rapa (A-genome) and B. nigra (B-genome), each harbouring two MYB28 paralogues. Both A-genome specific MYB28 paralogues showed very comparable expression profiles when tested across developing stages of B. rapa (Fig. 6A). The two BraMYB28 paralogues were abundantly expressed in glucosinolate synthesizing tissues such as seedling, leaf, and silique, whereas roots and flowers showed less accumulation of these transcripts. By contrast, when the expression profile of MYB28 homologues was studied in B. nigra, differential expression of the two BniMYB28 transcripts was observed. The BniB.MYB28.1 gene was highly expressed across all the developing stages, particularly in seedlings and roots, whereas the BniB.MYB28.2 transcript showed reduced expression in all the tested tissues (Fig. 6B).In order to determine whether there is a bias in transcript levels from one of the two genomes in the polyploid B. juncea, qRT-PCR analysis was performed for all four BjuMYB28 in the same tissue types. All four BjuMYB28 genes were expressed in most of the tissue types (Fig. 6C). Higher levels of expression were observed in seedling, stem, and siliques compared with root and primary leaf tissues. The expression profile of A-genome-specific BjuMYB28 genes was almost similar to that observed in B. rapa whereas the two B-genome specific homologues showed altered and reduced expression in B. juncea in most of the tissue types tested (Fig. 6). In general, the cumulative abundance of the A-genome-specific homologues was higher than the B-genome-specific homologues in most of the tissue types tested.Detailed expression analysis of A- and B-genome-specific BjuMYB28 genes was further performed at different developmental stages of leaves and siliques in B. juncea, the tissues where the biosynthesis of glucosinolates largely occurs. All four BjuMYB28 genes were expressed throughout leaf development, but had lower transcript abundance during the younger stages. However, the B-genome-specific BjuMYB28 genes had relatively higher transcript accumulation in the primary and young leaves with the onset of the reproductive phase. A significantly higher accumulation of all four BjuMYB28 transcripts was observed in the mature and inflorescence leaves (Fig. 7A). During the developing stages of the siliques (5, 10, 15, and 30 d post-anthesis), expression of both A-genome-specific BjuMYB28 homologues was comparably higher (Fig. 7B). The data clearly reflect the distinct expression of A- and B-genome-specific BjuMYB28 genes across the developmental stages of allopolyploid B. juncea.Histochemical analysis of ProBjuMYB28:uidA lines in Arabidopsis confirms differential regulation of BjuMYB28 In order to confirm the tissue- as well as cell-specific expression of A- and B-genome-specific BjuMYB28, ProBjuMYB28:uidA lines of all four BjuMYB28 promoters were developed in the closely related A. thaliana. Approximately 1kb upstream of the ATG (translation start codon) of the four BjuMYB28 genes was isolated from the B. juncea genome using a 5' genome walking protocol. The 5' upstream regions showed a much lower level of sequence identity compared with the protein-coding regions (see Supplementary Fig. S5 and Supplementary Table S5 at JXB online). Two independent single-copy transgenic lines of each BjuMYB28 promoter were used for detailed GUS histochemical analysis in the homozygous T3 generation.Reporter gene expression in transgenic Arabidopsis lines revealed that all four BjuMYB28 homologues showed overlapping but distinct expression patterns during the developing stages of A. thaliana (Fig. 8). Prominent GUS staining was detected in seedlings, mature rosette leaves, flowers, and siliques of ProBjuMYB28:uidA transgenic lines. Among all four promoters, those of BjuA.MYB28.1 and BjuA.MYB28.2 exhibited somewhat higher GUS staining than those of the other MYB28 genes in all floral organs including pistil, anther, and receptacle tissues as well as in the flower stalk (Fig. 8C). Similarly, a stronger reporter gene expression in the developing siliques was also observed for these promoters (Fig. 8D). Thus a higher GUS activity of A-genome versus B-genome-specific BjuMYB28 promoters was detected in the reproductive tissue. A trace amount of GUS activity was detected in mature roots, senescent leaves, and seeds for all the four BjuMYB28 promoters tested.In the rosette leaves of Arabidopsis, the BjuMYB28 promoters showed cell-specific GUS activity. The BjuB.MYB28.1 and BjuB.MYB28.2 promoters showed maximal activity in the edges and lamina of the leaves, respectively, whereas the activity of the BjuA.MYB28.2 promoter was observed in the mid-vein, primary and secondary veins and also towards the leaf edges (Fig. 8B). The BjuA.MYB28.1 promoter, however, showed traces of GUS staining in the leaf edges. This non-uniform and cell-specific expression pattern of BjuMYB28 genes within leaves might have important implications for the regulation of glucosinolate content and profile across different regions of the leaf. Thus, the GUS histochemical data obtained using the ProBjuMYB28:uidA Arabidopsis lines confirmed that the four BjuMYB28 promoters have overlapping but distinct cell and tissue expression patterns."}, "32213900": {"doi": "10.3390/nu12030868", "title": "Brassicaceae-Derived Anticancer Agents: Towards a Green Approach to Beat Cancer", "abstract": "Cancer is the main cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide.

IntroductionA large variety of tumors affect the human population. Cancer is characterized by a deregulation of key cellular functions, such as growth signaling, anti-apoptotic signaling, gene stability, immune response, and stromal microenvironment regulation. Although prevention, control strategies, and different treatments are available, the number of cancer patients increases each year, as does the mortality rate for this disease.Numerous clinical trials have been developed to investigate potential cancer cures. However, their toxic side effects have had negative impacts on the patients. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy show severe side effects due to their toxicity on healthy cells. Target-based therapy and immunotherapy, although highly specific in cancer targeting, can be applied to a limited target patient range and are very expensive. Furthermore, several kinds of cancer tend to relapse and acquire resistance after treatment. Currently, combined therapies are substituting monotherapy treatments to overcome their limitations. Moreover, significant effort is being made to search for more effective drugs with reduced side effects from new sources.For millennia, plants have been used in medical cures. Plant metabolites show a wide range of biological functions, such as anti-cancer, anti-analgesic, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammation activities. More than 60% of drugs with anti-cancer activity are derived from plants. Therefore, plant metabolites represent a good source for the development of efficacious therapeutic agents with reduced side effects.Several studies have reported the chemopreventive and anti-cancer properties of dietary agents. It has been observed that vegetable consumption is associated with a lower risk of developing cancer. Our main interest is vegetables belonging to the Brassicaceae family, such as broccoli and cauliflower, as these vegetables are a source of glucosinolates (GLs), from which other biologically active products are derived. Unfortunately, the approach of these studies seems to be heterogeneous and not conclusive.In this review, we discuss the potential properties of GLs derived from Brassicaceae as chemopreventive and anti-cancer agents, with respect to their absorption and metabolism in the human body.2. BrassicaceaeBrassicaceae (Cruciferae) is a large plant family including a wide range of vegetables, condiments, forage, and oil seed crops such as broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, kohl rabi (all cultivars of Brassica oleracea), radish (Raphanus sativus), mustard (Sinapis alba), and rapeseed (B. napus), as well as ornamentals (e.g., Arabis, Aubrieta, Erysimum, Iberis, Lunaria, Matthiola, and others), comprising several model plants (e.g., Arabidopsis thaliana, A. suecica, Arabis alpina, Cardamine hirsuta).Brassicaceae, also known as the \"mustard\" family, includes approximately 338 genera and 3709 species and is distributed worldwide in all continents except Antarctica. However, the species diversity is not equally distributed, and the most important diversification centers are found in the Irano-Turanian and Mediterranean regions. Their distribution pattern and several recent studies suggest that this plant family originated and diversified in the eastern Mediterranean (Asia Minor or present-day Turkey) and adjacent regions.The crucifers are phylogenetically sisters to the Cleomaceae family, and both families belong to the Brassicales order. A robust and reliable family tree has been recently developed. It is based on more than 100 orthologous nuclear markers retrieved from sequenced transcriptomes of 55 species belonging to the five major clades within the crown group (Figure 1).3. Brassicaceae PhytochemicalsAs with many other vegetables, crucifers are high in minerals, nutrients, and phytochemicals (e.g., selenium, folate, and fiber). Particularly, these vegetables are rich in sulfur-containing compounds, called glucosinolates (GLs), which are responsible for their pungent and spicy taste. GLs are especially abundant among families of the order Capparales: Tovariaceae, Resedaceae, Capparaceae, Moringaceae, and Brassicaceae. Families outside the order exhibit occasional occurrences and include Caricaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Gyrotemonaceae, Limnathaceae, Salvadoraceae, and Tropaeolaceae.It has been demonstrated that the chemopreventive potential of cruciferous vegetables is likely due to glucosinolates and their secondary metabolites (e.g., isothiocyanates (ITCs)). So far, more than 130 different glucosinolates have been identified from various plants, and the profiles of these compounds vary depending on cultivars and growing conditions. Depending on the molecular structure, they can be classified as aliphatic, aromatic, v-methylthioalkyl, or heterocyclic glucosinolates (Figure 2).GLs can be hydrolyzed by myrosinase (thioglucoside glucohydrolase, EC 3.2.1.147, formerly EC 3.2.3.1) to produce D-glucose and various other degradation products. Both the enzyme and substrates physically coexist in plants but are separated from each other. In Arabidopsis thaliana, GLs have been detected between the phloem and the endoderm, whereas myrosinase is found in the neighboring phloem parenchyma. Further, it has been demonstrated that myrosinase is localized in specialized GLS-free idioblast cells, termed myrosin cells, and its activity is highest in the seed and seedling stages.Initially, myrosinase-modified GLs release thiohydroximate-O-sulfate, an unstable aglucone (Figure 3). In the presence of the so-called epithiospecifier proteins (ESPs), aglucone degradation leads to the release of epithionitriles (EPTs) from alkenyl GLs and nitriles from non-alkenyl GLs. In the absence of ESPs, the aglucones spontaneously rearrange to form isothiocyanates (ITCs) and small amounts of nitriles. Nitrile specifier proteins (NSPs), which favor nitriles, as well as epithiospecifier modifiers (ESMs), which, in turn, favor isothiocyanate formation, have also been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana.Various studies suggest that GLs may play an important role in herbivore and microbial defense by their potent odor and taste. High levels of these compounds (\"mustard oil bomb\") are quickly released upon tissue damage, constituting a very effective defense against some generalist herbivores. Further, GL degradation products are known for their fungicidal, bactericidal, nematocidal, and allelopathic properties. Recently, GLs and their degradation products have attracted intense research interest because of their cancer chemoprotective properties.In plants, the GL profiles and contents are affected by various parameters, including: temperature, irradiation, nutrition, and water supply; their management (organic vs. conventional); wounding and biotic factors, such as herbivores; and by intrinsic plant-determined factors, such as (onto)genetic influences, which can induce an enormous variation in GL levels, even within the plant. Furthermore, according to the stage of plant development, different GL profiles have been found. High concentrations of aliphatic or aromatic GLs have usually been found in seeds, while after germination, their content progressively decreases and the total GL content increases due to higher indole GL levels.4. ITC Anti-Cancer Activity in Different TumorsIn vitro and in vivo studies have shown that ITCs are able to activate phase II detoxification enzymes (such as quinone reductase and glutathione S-transferase) as well as to disrupt tubulin polymerization, inducing cell cycle arrest and the activation of apoptosis in cancer cells. Additionally, since dietary ITCs are well absorbed and have good bioavailability, these compounds are promising candidates for anti-cancer therapies.Particularly, the bioactivity and fate of the downstream metabolites sulforaphane (SFN) and erucin (ECN) from alkyl isothiocyanates, as well as indole-3-carbinol from indolyl glucosinolates, have been heavily investigated in humans to explore their roles in carcinogenesis and cancer progression modulation (Table 1).4.1. Alkyl Isothiocyanates and Cancer4.1.1. SulforaphaneSeveral studies have shown that SFN induces apoptosis and inhibits the progression and metastasis of many cancers.Recently, it was found that the consumption of glucoraphanin-rich broccoli soup affects gene expression in the prostates of men on active surveillance, consistent with a reduction in the risk of cancer progression. Broccoli sprouts are considered a functional food as they are naturally enriched in glucoraphanin (GR), which is the biological precursor of sulforaphane (SFN), a compound mainly found in broccoli sprouts, Chinese kale, cabbage, and watercress. Due to its health-promoting value, broccoli sprout juice is becoming very popular.It was previously reported that dietary consumption of SFN and broccoli was correlated with a reduction in tumor size and growth in a breast cancer rodent model. It has been demonstrated that this effect may be associated with the role of SFN in repressing the cyclin-dependent kinase 4- D-type cyclin (CDK4-CCND) complex via the downregulation of SERTAD1 gene expression, leading to an increase in the breast cancer population in the G1 phase.Moreover, the anti-cancer effects of SFN and other bioactive phytochemicals from medicinal plants have been investigated in combination with conventional therapies for breast cancer treatment. Interestingly, it has been observed that docetaxel (at a dose of 10 mg/kg once every 7 days) decreased tumor growth of established tumors by 83.2%, whereas SFN (at a dose of 50 mg/kg daily) inhibited primary tumor growth by 37.4% in a SUM149 breast tumor xenograft mouse model. The combination of SFN and docetaxel enhanced the reduction in the primary tumor volume (92.5% reduction compared with control) and synergistically inhibited the cancer stem cell (CSC) population compared with docetaxel alone.Furthermore, preliminary data show that SFN may prevent or treat breast cancer by inducing estrogen-induced metabolic changes. It has been demonstrated that estrogen can enhance purine metabolism to promote DNA biogenesis, while estradiol treatment was shown to induce an increase in amino acids levels, such as L-proline and L-arginine in breast cancer cells (MCF-7). Both purine metabolites and amino acids are critical nutrients for cells, providing them with the necessary energy and cofactors to stimulate their cell survival and proliferation and thus tumor progression. In this context, it has been observed that SFN reduces the levels of related purine metabolites and amino acids in MCF-7 cancer cells, providing a novel insight into the potential mechanism by which SFN may act as a cancer chemopreventive agent.Additionally, it was demonstrated that sulforaphane is able to reduce the proliferation capacity of human (SKOV3) and mouse (C3 and T3) ovarian cancer cell lines by downregulating cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4 and CDK6).Interestingly, sulforaphane has been shown to sensitize cancer cells resistant to chemotherapy. SFN overcame adriamycin- and cisplatin-resistance in ovarian cancer, suggesting that it may help to reduce chemotherapeutic compound doses as well as their side effects.The effects of SFN have also been evaluated in melanoma. It has been demonstrated that SFN impairs the viability of melanoma cell lines (A375 and 501MEL cells) in a dose- and time-dependent manner, while it does not affect non-cancerous epidermal melanocytes (HEMa). Studies have shown that SFN increases the percentage of apoptotic melanoma cells by cleaving poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), activating p-p53, caspase-3, caspase-8, and caspase-9, and decreasing Bcl2 expression, thus confirming its pro-apoptotic role. SFN is a very attractive multipotent anti-cancer agent, and its use could open new avenues for preventing tumor growth and treating human malignancies. Sulforaphanes as well as other phytocompounds (e.g., curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), resveratrol, lycopene, SR-T100, several flavonoids, wogonin, Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA), ginsenosides, and genistein derivatives) have been demonstrated to reduce CSC-related marker levels and inhibit CSC-related signaling pathways in ovarian cancer, suggesting their potential use to overcome its chemoresistance and relapse, mainly due to the CSC fraction.Interestingly, SFN reverses gefitinib tolerance in human lung cancer cells via the modulation of Sonic Hedgehog (Hh) signaling and regulates the self-renewal of pancreatic CSCs through the Sonic Hh pathway both in vivo and in vitro. Additionally, SFN demonstrated a suppressive effect on gastric CSCs via the Sonic Hh pathway.4.1.2. ErucinErucin (ERU) is an isothiocyanate derived from the glucosinolate glucoerucin, which is typically found in high amounts in wild rocket (from Eruca sativa Mill.).ERU is also derived from SFN biotransformation by sulfur atom reduction in the human body, and has been described as a slow H2S-releasing compound like other natural ITCs such allyl isothiocyanate, 4-hydroxybenzyl isothiocyanate, benzyl isothiocyanate, and SFN (previously described). H2S is a well-known endogenous gasotransmitter, which plays a critical role in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems as well as in cell growth regulation.Anti-cancer and chemopreventive activities are some of the proposed biological properties described for isothiocyanates. Interestingly, it is their particular behavior known as \"hormesis\" that has also been used to describe the action of the endogenous gasotransmitter hydrogen sulfide. ITCs and low H2S concentrations are able to promote cell proliferation, whereas high concentrations inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis in a variety of cancers.It has been described that endogenous H2S, as well as exposure to low levels of exogenous H2S donors for a short time, lead to anti-apoptotic effects in tumor cells, enhancing cancer growth. On the contrary, long-term treatment with a relatively high concentration of H2S donors inhibits tumor cell proliferation in different types of cancers, thus suggesting that slow-releasing H2S donors may represent a promising anti-cancer therapeutic strategy.ERU is able to increase the release of H2S inside AsPC-1 cells, one of the most aggressive pancreatic adenocarcinoma cell lines, in a concentration-dependent manner, exhibiting a hermetic behavior similar to other natural H2S donors showing anti-cancer effects, such as GYY4137 and acetyl deacylase disulfide.Interestingly, ERU, combined with lapatinib, is able to strongly decrease the metastatic potential of breast tumor cells, even the ones with a drug-resistant phenotype.4.1.3. Indole-3-Carbinol in CancerIndole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a natural compound derived from the breakdown of the glucosinolate glucobrassicin, which is found in broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, collard greens, Brussels sprouts, and kale.I3C has shown antiproliferative effects in several colon cancer cell lines (HT29, WS480, Colo320, Caco-2, HCT-116) and hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Interestingly, this molecule is able to induce cell cycle arrest by upregulating mi-RNA-34a expression in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells as well as cell death via the apoptosis of ERalpha-positive breast cancer cells.However, most of this evidence refers to in vitro experiments. The process is more complex in vivo. The main critical point is the measurement of these compounds in the organism, for example, isothiocyanates are rapidly metabolized in the gut and liver and are eliminated in urine; furthermore, their half-lives and effectiveness depend on a number of factors, such as how they are absorbed through food, the frequency of absorption, the metabolism of these compounds, as well as genetic factors due to polymorphisms, which can modify the absorption and metabolism of phytochemicals."}, "34259546": {"doi": "10.1128/Spectrum.00180-21", "title": "Sclerotinia sclerotiorum Response to Long Exposure to Glucosinolate Hydrolysis Products by Transcriptomic Approach", "abstract": "ABSTRACTWhite mold disease, caused by the necrotrophic fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, affects Brassica crops. Brassica crops produce a broad array of compounds, such as glucosinolates, which contribute to the defense against pathogens. From their hydrolysis, several products arise that have antimicrobial activity (GHPs) whose toxicity is structure dependent. S. sclerotiorum may overcome the toxic effect of moderate GHP concentrations after prolonged exposure to their action. Our objective was to identify the molecular mechanism underlying S. sclerotiorum response to long exposure to two chemically diverse GHPs: aliphatic GHP allyl-isothiocyanate (AITC) and indole GHP indol-3-carbinol (I3C). We found that the transcriptomic response is dependent on the type of GHP and on their initial target, involving cell membranes in the case of AITC or DNA in the case of I3C. Response mechanisms include the reorganization of chromatin, mediated by histone chaperones hip4 and cia1, ribosome synthesis controlled by the kinase-phosphatase pair aps1-ppn1, catabolism of proteins, ergosterol synthesis, and induction of detoxification systems. These mechanisms probably help S. sclerotiorum to grow and survive in an environment where GHPs are constantly produced by Brassica plants upon glucosinolate breakdown.IMPORTANCE Brassica species, including important vegetable crops, such as cabbage, cauliflower, or broccoli, or oil crops, such as rapeseed, produce specific chemical compounds useful to protect them against pests and pathogens. One of the most destructive Brassica diseases in temperate areas around the world is Sclerotinia stem rot, caused by the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. This is a generalist pathogen that causes disease over more than 400 plant species, being a serious threat to economically important crops worldwide, including potato, bean, soybean, and sunflower, among many others. Understanding the mechanisms utilized by pathogens to overcome specific plant defensive compounds can be useful to increase plant resistance. Our study demonstrated that Sclerotinia shows different adaptation mechanisms, including detoxification systems, to grow and survive when plant protective compounds are present.", "intro": "INTRODUCTIONSclerotinia sclerotiorum is a necrotrophic fungal pathogen that attacks at least 408 species of plants from 278 genera, belonging to 75 families. S. sclerotiorum produces the so-called Sclerotinia stem rot or white mold in Brassica crops, whose symptoms include the rotting of leaves, stems, and pods, which causes important economic losses, especially for oil crops.Brassica plants can produce a broad array of compounds that contribute to the defense against S. sclerotiorum. This includes regulatory hormones such as jasmonic acid, salicylic acid, and ethylene as well as defensive compounds like glucosinolates. These are secondary metabolites present in the Brassicaeae family, derived from amino acids. Depending on the side chain of the amino acid, glucosinolates can be classified as aliphatic (derived from methionine, alanine, valine, leucine, and isoleucine), aromatic (derived from phenylalanine or tyrosine), and indolic (derived from tryptophan). Myrosinase enzymes hydrolyze glucosinolates into several chemically diverse products (GHPs). Hydrolysis occurs upon tissue breakdown produced by the attack of herbivores or necrotrophic pathogens. Depending on the nature of the glucosinolate side chain and the physicochemical conditions of the medium, such as pH, availability of ferrous ions, and the level and activity of specific protein factors, such as epithio specifier one, glucosinolates can hydrolyze into isothiocyanates (ITCs), nitriles, thiocyanates, epithionitriles, oxazolidine-2-thiones, epithioalkanes, and indoles. GHPs show antimicrobial effects in vitro against a broad range of fungal and bacterial plant pathogens. Among GHPs, ITCs are the most toxic ones, even at low concentrations.Glucosinolates and their GHPs have a role in the defense against S. sclerotiorum in planta and in vitro. Fungal response is dependent on the GHP chemical structure. However, to date, mechanisms through which GHPs exert their toxicity and the ways fungi can overcome it have not been completely understood. Broadly speaking, ITCs can act directly by covalent binding/modification of certain nucleophile-containing proteins, referred to as a target, or indirectly by activating gene transcription. S. sclerotiorum can overcome toxic effects driven by sublethal concentrations of ITCs after a short exposure, basically by inducing antioxidant defenses and efflux pumpers, similar to other necrotrophic fungi, such as Alternaria brassicicola. This would allow the initial plant colonization by the fungus. However, as the disease progresses, more glucosinolates hydrolyze and S. sclerotiorum is exposed, during the infection period, to the GHP action. In addition, within a plant, there are glucosinolates of different chemical classes simultaneously hydrolyzing to different GHPs, whose toxicity is structure dependent. In this line, this study aimed at identifying the molecular mechanisms underlying S. sclerotiorum response to long exposure to two chemically diverse GHPs. Identifying response mechanisms will allow advancing our understanding of the interaction of Brassica plants with S. sclerotiorum.", "results": "RESULTSPhenotypic effect of GHP treatments on S. sclerotiorum.S. sclerotiorum mycelia took more time to reach the end of the petri dish when they were treated with GHPs than control samples. This effect was clearer when samples were treated with I3C (Fig. 1A). Once AITC and control sample mycelia reached the end of petri dishes, they started producing sclerotia on the edge. However, sclerotia from I3C-treated samples also were produced in the midpoint of petri dishes (Fig. 1B). 100 muM AITC provoked membrane permeabilization, and it was half that by 70% ethanol (Fig. 1C). No permeabilization effect was observed for I3C (Fig. 1D).Transcriptomic analysis.Averages of 14,960,380, 16,415,912, and 10,776,800 tag sequences were obtained from the control and samples treated with AITC and I3C. To offer a general result overview, GO analysis with all of the annotated transcripts was conducted for each comparison (GHP versus control and AITC versus I3C) with GO-Tool2. We describe the most important features found under the biological process (BP) category (see Table S1 in the supplemental material).AITC versus control.Transcript analysis resulted in 212 significantly enriched GO terms (P <= 0.05 and -1 <= log2 fold change >= 1), from which 181 were induced and 31 were repressed. The most significant induced GO terms were related to mitosis and cell division (i.e., GO:1901989, GO:1901992, GO:1903047, and GO:0051301). Other categories were related to the organonitrogen compound metabolic process (GO:1901564) and the small-molecule metabolic process (GO:0044281). Otherwise, there is a large set of significantly enriched terms associated with the positive regulation of the proteasomal protein catabolic process (GO:1901800 and GO:0032436). The first six most significantly repressed GO terms are related to toxin biosynthetic pathways (GO:1901376, GO:1901378, GO:0045461, GO:0045460, GO:0009403, and GO:0009404). Several terms were related to apoptosis and cell death (GO:0006915, GO:0012501, GO:0008219, and GO:0016265). Other significant terms included processes related to mitochondrial transmembrane transport (GO:1990542 and GO:0045041), mitochondrial DNA repair (GO:0043504), and maturation of LSU-rRNA (GO:0000463 and GO:0000470).I3C versus control.GO analysis of I3C versus control treatment rendered 197 significant GO terms, from which 190 were repressed and 7 were induced. Significantly induced GO terms were mostly related to amino acid synthesis, including serine (GO:0009070 and GO:0009092), threonine (GO:0009088), and sulfur amino acids (GO:0000097). The ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process via the multivesicular body sorting pathway (GO:0043162) and glyoxylate metabolic process (GO:0046487) were also significant. A large part of significant GO repressed terms were related to translation and ribosome biogenesis and assembly (GO:0002181, GO:0042273, and GO:0042255). Among the most significant GO downregulated terms, we could find several terms related to stress and stimulus response (GO:1901700, GO:0042221, GO:0006970, GO:0009408, and GO:0010035). Other significantly repressed terms were involved in the small-molecule metabolic process and nucleobase-containing small-molecule metabolic process (GO:0044281 and GO:0055086) and toxin biosynthetic process (GO:0009403).AITC versus I3C.Expression of 296 GOs was higher in mycelia treated with AITC than in mycelia treated with I3C. Among them, we can find terms related to cell division, such as positive regulation of metaphase/anaphase transition of the cell cycle (GO:1902101), positive regulation of cell cycle phase transition (GO:1901989), or actin polymerization or depolymerization (GO:0008154). Other terms are related to catabolic processes, such as positive regulation of the proteasomal protein catabolic process (GO:1901800) and positive regulation of proteolysis (GO:0045862). Translation (GO:0006412), ribonucleoprotein complex assembly (GO:0022618), endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-nucleus signaling pathway (GO:0006984), cellular response to sterol depletion (GO:0071501), and fungus-type cell wall biogenesis (GO:0009272) were also upregulated by AITC. The expression of four GO terms was higher in the treatment with I3C compared to AITC: mitochondrial DNA repair (GO:0043504), cellular response to light stimulus (GO:0071482), mitochondrial DNA metabolic process (GO:0032042), and response to light stimulus (GO:0009416).Differentially expressed genes.There was a higher number of DEGs in response to AITC than in response to I3C compared to control samples. Thirty genes were commonly induced by both treatments, and 98 were repressed (Fig. 2A and B). In the AITC versus I3C comparison, 291 DEGs were induced in response to AITC, and 427 were induced in response to I3C (fig. 2C). Relationships among DEGs from each comparison were deduced by using the web tool STRING (v10.5). One hundred twenty-three DEGs from the AITC versus control comparison interact in a single network (Fig. 3). DEGs interact in several clusters related to sterol and lipid synthesis, proteasome, translation, cell division, and DNA replication (Fig. 3, Table S2). Twenty-one DEGs interact in two different networks in the I3C versus control comparison (Fig. 4, Table S2). Part of network 1's structure (including DEGs mad2, klp9, mug190, ish1, hsp9, and SPAC32A11) is shared with the network of the AITC versus control comparison. In both comparisons, mad2 and klp9 are induced and mug190, ish1, hsp9, and SPAC32A11 are repressed.Seventy-four DEGs are interacting in the AITC versus I3C comparison (Fig. 5, Table S2) in two different networks. In network 1, there is a cluster of structural proteins related to ribosome synthesis, which are more highly induced by AITC than by I3C. All these structural proteins are related to protein Aps1, which is repressed by I3C and induced by AITC. In this network, a cluster of DEGs related to ergosterol synthesis (induced by AITC) and leucine synthesis (induced by I3C) also appears, interacting with protein SPAC22A12.16.1. In network 2, several DEGs, hip4, hhf1, mst1, and ngg1, are induced by AITC, whereas DEGs rhp6, ubc7, rev1, and rhp14 are induced by I3C. Both branches are connected by DEG cia1, which is induced by I3C and repressed by AITC.DEGs in the three comparisons that were related to detoxification of GHPs and toxin biosynthesis are shown in Table 1."}, "38412618": {"doi": "10.1021/acssynbio.3c00676"}, "30235823": {"doi": "10.3390/ijms19092833", "title": "Altered Glucosinolate Profiles and Expression of Glucosinolate Biosynthesis Genes in Ringspot-Resistant and Susceptible Cabbage Lines", "abstract": "Ringspot, caused by the fungus Mycosphaerella brassicicola, is a serious disease of Brassica crops worldwide. Despite noteworthy progress to reveal the role of glucosinolates in pathogen defense, the host-pathogen interaction between cabbage (Brassica oleracea) and M. brassicicola has not been fully explored. Here, we investigated the glucosinolate profiles and expression of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes in the ringspot-resistant (R) and susceptible (S) lines of cabbage after infection with M. brassicicola. The concomitant rise of aliphatic glucoiberverin (GIV) and indolic glucobrassicin (GBS) and methoxyglucobrassicin (MGBS) was linked with ringspot resistance in cabbage. Pearson's correlation and principle component analysis showed a significant positive association between GIV contents and the expression of the glucosinolate biosynthesis gene ST5b-Bol026202 and between GBS contents and the expression of the glucosinolate biosynthesis gene MYB34-Bol017062. Our results confirmed that M. brassicicola infection induces the expression of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes in cabbage, which alters the content of individual glucosinolates. This link between the expression of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes and the accumulation of their respective glucosinolates with the resistance to ringspot extends our molecular sense of glucosinolate-negotiated defense against M. brassicicola in cabbage.", "intro": "1. IntroductionRingspot is a common fungal disease of cabbage (Brassica oleracea) that causes economic losses worldwide. Ringspot is caused by the homothallic ascomycete Mycosphaerella brassicicola, and it is most common in countries with temperate and humid climates. High humidity (>90%), temperature (5-20  C), and moist leaf surfaces for 3-4 days are important factors for M. brassicicola infection. Ringspot can quickly become an epidemic in cabbage, emphasizing the need for resistant varieties. To date, only a few studies have been conducted to explore the interactions between the host and pathogen in the B. oleracea-M. brassicicola patho-system. Resistance genes and secondary metabolites involved in plant-pathogen interactions provide general resistance to pathogens and insects. Glucosinolates (GSLs) are vital secondary metabolites found in Brassicaceae that are biosynthesized from amino acids, and they play anti-oxidative and anti-carcinogenic roles in humans. GSLs also play a role in resistance to insect pests and pathogens in plants. Aliphatic and indolic GSLs are the two most important types of GSLs that are present in Brassicaceae. GSLs and their hydrolyzed products showed significant antimicrobial and insecticidal activities, as well as anti-fungal properties in plants. GSLs are the precursors of sulfur- and nitrogen-containing secondary metabolites, such as iso-thiocyanates and sulforaphane. The effects of GSL metabolism, and sulfur and nitrogen nutrition have been studied because brassica crops contain large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids and GSLs. In a study on the antimicrobial effect of crude extracts from Arabidopsis thaliana, 4-methylsulfonyl butyl iso-thiocyanate was found to be the main active compound, and it showed broad antimicrobial activity, thereby demonstrating the possible protective role of GSL-derived isothiocyanate against pathogens. A survey of the levels of GSLs in different brassica varieties showed alterations to the GSL profile at the time of inoculation by fungal pathogens. These changes were mainly due to an increase in aliphatic, indolic, and aromatic GSLs. In general, GSL degradation products induce the plant defense response against pathogens and general herbivores (Rask et al., 2000; Barth and Jander, 2006). Biotic and abiotic factors, such as pathogen infection, herbivore damage, mechanical injury, or mineral nutrition, modulate the GSL profile. A wide range of defense reactions can affect GSL content. However, an association between GSL levels and resistance to various fungal pathogens in brassicas has not yet been established.Pathogen resistance has not been strongly correlated with the contents of GSLs following fungal infections in different brassica species. The best in vivo evidence for the protective role of GSLs comes from the MAMl mutation study, where a decrease in GSL levels in Arabidopsis led to susceptibility to Fusarium oxysporum. GSL levels were positively correlated with oilseed rape resistance to pathogens Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, with a few exceptions. The inconsistency in these data may reflect individual fungal behavior (e.g., necrotrophs versus biotrophs), their host specificity (e.g., brassica-specialist versus broad-spectrum), the genetic purity of the host plants (e.g., isogenic versus heterozygous lines), and the amount of GSL and its degradation products that are produced by the host plant. The relationship between GSL content and its resistance to M. braassicicola has not yet been studied. Several recent reports have shown that resistance to obligate biotrophs, hemibiotrophs, and necrotrophs might be linked with the production of indolic GSLs in Brassicaceae. These findings on the association of resistance with the GSL profile of brassica species prompted us to examine plant-pathogen interactions at the molecular and biochemical levels. Upregulation of GSL biosynthesis genes was linked with increased contents of individual GSL compounds in B. oleracea inbred lines. Here, we investigated the correlation between GSL profiles in resistant and susceptible cabbage lines, and the expression of GSL biosynthesis genes upon infection with the M. brassicicola IPO-99008 isolate.", "results": "2. Results2.1. Resistance of the Cabbage Lines to M. brassicicolaInoculation of cabbage leaves with M. brassicicola isolate IPO-99008 resulted in different responses in the 26 cabbage lines based on the scoring criteria of ringspot disease symptoms (Table 1, Figures S1 and S3). Two lines, BN4071 and BN4072 (the R line), exhibited complete resistance with no disease symptoms, while the other lines were moderately to highly susceptible to the M. brassicicola isolate IPO-99008 (Table 1). Disease progression was also determined in the R line BN4072, and the S line, BN3449, up to 30 DAI (days after inoculation) (Figure 1).2.2. Overview of the Profile of Individual GSLs in the R and S Lines of Cabbage after M. Brassicicola InoculationIndividual glucosinolate compounds identified in cabbage leaves of different samples are shown in Figure 2A and Supplementary file 1 and 2. HPLC analysis identified nine types of GSL compounds (glucoiberin (GIB), sinigrin (SIN), glucoerucin (GER), gluconapin (GNA), glucoiberverin (GIV), hydroxyglucobrassicin (HGBS), glucobrassicin (GBS), mythoxyglucobrassicin (MGBS), and neoglucobrassicin (NGBS)) in the R line, BN4072, and the S line, BN3449, of cabbage. In uninfected control plants, the amount of both aliphatic and indolic GSLs (i.e., GIB, GNA, and GBS) varied significantly between the R and S lines (Figure 2B). In the control plants, GIB and GNA levels were higher in the S line compared to the R line, whereas the opposite was observed for GBS. Inoculation of third-leaf stage cabbage plants with M. brassicicola fungal isolate IPO-99008 significantly changed the GSL profiles in the leaves of the R and S lines. In the R line, the levels of GIV significantly increased by 8.58-fold at 14 DAI compared to the mock-treated plants (Figure 2B). In contrast, the levels of GIV were not significantly altered after fungal infection in the S line (Figure 2B, Table S5). The levels of MGBS significantly increased by 6.20-fold at 14 DAI in the R line compared to the mock-treated plants, whereas the levels of MGBS were not significantly altered in the S line after infection. (Figure 2B, Table S5). The levels of GBS increased by 3.82-fold in the R line compared to the mock-treated plants at 14 DAI (Figure 2B, Table S5), whereas there were no significant changes in GBS levels in the S line after infection compared to the mock-treated plants (Figure 2B). GIV and MGBS showed an increasing trend only in the R line after infection. In the S line, GIB was significantly increased by 1.62-fold at 1 DAI compared to the mock-treated plants (Figure 2B). Overall, our results showed that the contents of both aliphatic GIV and indolic GBS and MGBS increased in the R line at the time of infection (Figure 2B). By contrast, the level of GIB was increased in the S line after infection. In addition, total GSLs were increased in the R line, but they were decreased in the S line at 14 DAI (Figure S6).2.3. Upregulation of MYB34-Bol017062, MYB34-Bol036262, ST5b-Bol026202, and ST5c-Bol030757 in the R Line after InoculationThe expression levels of 38 GSL pathway-related genes are given in the Supplementary file 1 and 3. Among the aliphatic and indolic GSL biosynthesis genes, only one indolic GSL transcription factor-related gene, MYB34-Bol017062, showed a 9.25-fold upregulation at 14 DAI in the R line (Figure 3, Table 2, and Table S2). The following genes were also significantly upregulated in the R line at 14 DAI compared to the mock-treated plants: MYB34-Bol036262 by 4.46-fold, ST5b-Bol026202 by 14.07-fold, and ST5c-Bol030757 by 27.31-fold (Figure 3). 2.4. Upregulation of Transcription Factor-Related Genes and GSL Biosynthesis Genes in the S Line after InoculationThe expression levels of 11 GSL biosynthesis genes were measured in the control, mock-treated, and infected plants. In the uninfected control plants, one transcription factor, MYB28-Bol017019, involved in aliphatic GSL biosynthesis, and one indolic GSL biosynthesis gene, IGMT1-Bol007029, showed significantly higher expression in the R line compared to the S line (Figure 4). In the S line at 1 DAI, MYB28-Bol017019 and MYB122-Bol026204, which encode transcription factor-related genes related to the aliphatic and indolic GSLs, had increased expression (6.1- and 8.0-fold, respectively) compared to the mock-treated plants (Figure 4, Table 2 and Table S2). In addition, the aliphatic GSL biosynthesis genes FMOGS-OX2-Bol010993 and AOP2-Bo2g102190 had 2.6- and 8.3-fold higher expression, respectively, in the S line at 1 DAI, compared to the mock-treated plants (Figure 4, Table 2 and Table S3). The expression levels of seven indolic GSL biosynthesis genes were also increased in the S line after inoculation with M. braassicicola compared to the mock-treated plants: ST5a -Bol039395 by 3.1-fold, CYP81F1-Bol028913 by 3.9-fold, CYP81F2-Bol014239 by 1.8-fold, IGMT1-Bol007029 by 2.0-fold, IGMT1-Bol020663 by 11.4-fold, and IGMT2-Bol007030 by 4.3-fold at 1 DAI, and CYP81F4-Bol028918 by 5.6-fold at 3 DAI (Figure 4, Table 2 and Table S4).2.5. Upregulation of Transcription Factor-Related Genes and GSL Biosynthesis Genes in the R and S LinesAmong the 38 transcription factor-related genes and GSL biosynthesis genes, the expression of 12 genes were higher in the S line compared to the R line after inoculation (Table 2, Figure S4). MYB28-Bol036743, MYB29-Bol008849, and MYB51-Bol030761, which encode transcription factors related to the aliphatic and indolic GSLs, had 4.0-, 11.0-, and 4.9-fold increased expression, respectively, in the S line at 1 DAI, compared to the mock-treated plants (Table 2 and Table S2, Figure S4). In the R line, increased expression was found in the indolic GSL biosynthesis pathway genes compared to the mock-treated plants as follows: CYP81F4-Bol032712 by 15.44-fold at 1 DAI, CYP81F3-Bol032711 by 9.26-fold at 3 DAI, CYP81F2-Bol026044 by 12.86-fold at 1 DAI and 16.08-fold at 14 DAI, and CYP81F4-Bol032714 by 15.35-fold at 1 DAI (Figure S4, Table 2 and Tables S2-S4). Conversely, the upregulation of these genes in the S line after infection compared to the mock-treated plants was lower than that observed in the R line: CYP81F4-Bol032712 by 6.1-fold at 1 DAI, CYP81F3-Bol032711 by 5.69-fold at 3 DAI, CYP81F2-Bol026044 by 3.3-fold at 1 DAI and 1.25-fold at 14 DAI, and CYP81F4-Bol032714 by 22.8-fold (5-fold lower than in the R line) at 1 DAI (Figure S4, Table 2 and Tables S2-S4). In the control plants, the expression levels of one aliphatic transcription factor-related gene, MYB28-Bol036286, and two indolic GSL biosynthesis genes, CYP81F1-Bol017375 and CYP81F1-Bol017376, were higher in the R line than in the S line and some asymmetrical response of expression were found in both the R and S lines (Figure S5). 2.6. Correlation between the Levels of Individual GSLs and the Expression Level of GSL Biosynthesis Pathway Genes Induced by M. brassicicola in the R and S Lines A heat map emphasized that the fold changes in the expression levels of transcription factor-related genes and GSL biosynthesis genes observed after pathogen inoculation were consistent with the changes in the levels of individual GSLs measured in the R and S lines, compared to their mock-treated samples. Pearson's correlation coefficients showed the highest significant positive correlation with the aliphatic GSLs GIB, SIN, and GER with FMOGS-OX2-Bol010993 expression; whereas a positive correlation was also observed for SIN with MYB28-Bol017019 expression; GNA with FMOGS-OX5-Bol031350 expression; and GIV with ST5b-Bol026202 expression (Figure 5A). In the case of indolic GSLs, GBS, and MGBS had the highest significant positive correlation with MYB34-Bol017062 expression but NGBS had the highest significant positive correlation with CYP81F2-Bol014239 expression (Figure 5B). These data show the association of these genes with changes in the GSL profile. Principal component analysis (PCA) of the contents of the nine individual GSL components and the expression of the GSL biosynthesis pathway genes revealed the accumulation of individual GSL components and gene expression towards ringspot R line BN4072 and S line BN3449 of cabbage. There was a major contrast among the gene expression patterns. The first four PCs explained 90.2% of the total variation in the datasets (Table S8). In PC1, which accounted for 47.7% of the total variation, was largely demonstrated by higher positive coefficients for NGBS, GIB, GNA, GER, SIN, and HGBS versus lower negative coefficients for GIV, GBS, and MGBS. The other positive and negative coefficients for gene expression are presented in Supplementary Table S8. However, PC2 explained 23.0% of the total variation, which largely showed a contrast between the positive coefficients for MGBS, NGBS, GIB, GNA, and GER and the negative coefficients for GIV, SIN, GBS, and HGBS. PC2 clearly distinguished the R line from the S line based on GSL profiles, and the expression of the GSL biosynthesis genes (Figure 6 and Table S8).

Quinone reductase inducing bioactivity, an estimate of anti-cancer chemopreventive potential, of the extracts was measured using a hepa1c1c7 murine cell line. Extracts from root tissues were significantly different from other tissues and contained high levels of gluconasturtiin and glucoerucin. Targeted gene expression analysis on glucosinolate biosynthesis revealed that broccoli root tissue has elevated gene expression of AOP2 and low expression of FMOGS-OX homologs, essentially the opposite of what was observed in broccoli florets, which accumulated high levels of glucoraphanin. Broccoli floret tissue has significantly higher nitrile formation (%) and epithionitrile specifier protein gene expression than other tissues. This study provides basic information of the glucosinolate metabolome and transcriptome for various tissues of Brassica oleracea that maybe utilized as potential byproducts for the nutraceutical market.", "intro": "IntroductionBrassica crops have been domesticated by humans into morphotypes for which different tissues are used for consumption. Therefore, only a portion of Brassica crop biomass is harvested and utilized for food and feed. For example, broccoli florets represent less than 10% of total aerial biomass of the plant. Can residual biomass after harvest of Brassica vegetables be utilized to yield value-added co-products?Broccoli and cauliflower production values in United States of America (USA) during 2015 were $1.035 billion and $371 million, respectively. Broccoli production in 2015 was 17.6 million tons. Assuming only 10% of broccoli is used for food, then about 158 million tons of by-product of broccoli was produced at 2015 in USA. Like broccoli, cauliflower and other Brassica crops also have considerable amounts of unused by-products after harvest. Despite the potential economic value of these by-products, there is little information available on the nutritional value and other potentially beneficial bioactivities of unharvested tissues of broccoli (leaves and roots) and collards (roots) due to limited interest in these non-edible tissues. However, these tissues can potentially be utilized as anti-bacterial, anti-nematodal, allelopathic (weed management) agents, or feedstocks for extraction of pharmaceutical products.Glucosinolates are sulfur and nitrogen-containing secondary metabolites found primarily in the Brassicaceae. Glucosinolate biosynthesis occurs from amino acid precursors through chain elongation, core structure formation, and side-chain modifications. Among these glucosinolates, biosynthesis of side-chain groups and subsequent modification is attributed to differences in bioactivity among the glucosinolates, and more specifically, their hydrolysis products. Sulforaphane (SF) is one of the most potent chemopreventive agents in broccoli, hydrolyzed from its precursor, glucoraphanin, by myrosinase. The biosynthesis of glucoraphanin is derived from methionine and goes through multiple steps to generate the methylthioalkyl glucosinolates. A subclade of flavin-monooxygenases (FMOGS-OX1-5) catalyze the conversion of methylthioalkyl glucosinolates (e.g. glucoerucin) into methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolates (e.g. glucoraphanin). An alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase called AOP2 has been demonstrated to control the conversion of methylsulfinylalkyl glucosinolates (e.g. glucoraphanin) to alkenyl glucosinolates (e.g. gluconapin). Thus, in order to accumulate glucoraphanin, the precursor to SF, the gene expression level of FMOGS-OX1-5 and AOP2 should theoretically be high and low, respectively.Glucosinolates themselves are not bioactive compounds. It is their hydrolysis products, formed by the removal of the glucose moiety by the endogenous enzyme, myrosinase, that have been reported to possess many bioactivities, including cancer-prevention, biofumigation, and anti-microbial activities. The chemical structure of these hydrolysis products depends on the structure of the glucosinolate side-chain and reaction conditions such as pH, concentration of Fe2+, and presence/absence of specifier proteins, such as epithiospecifier protein (ESP). There are a number of potential specifier proteins, including the epithiospecifier modifier 1 (ESM1) gene in Arabidopsis, which encodes a protein shown to inhibit function of ESP, leading to increased isothiocyanate production from glucosinolate hydrolysis. In the absence of specifier proteins, the addition of Fe2+ ions also promotes nitrile formation. Nitriles are weak chemopreventive compounds compared to the isothiocyanates like sulforaphane (SF) and phenethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC).In the past few decades, research on glucosinolates in crop plants has increased following the discovery of their putative role as cancer-prevention agents, primarily due to their induction of phase II detoxification enzymes, among other beneficial bioactivities. Quinone reductase (QR), a phase II enzyme, is present in mammalian tissues and has been used as a biomarker of anticarcinogenic activity from Brassica crops. QR acts as a catalyst in the conversion of reactive and toxic quinones into stable and non-toxic hydroquinones, reducing oxidative cycling. The health benefits of Brassica vegetables are strongly associated with hydrolysis products created from glucosinolates by endogenous myrosinase. Isothiocyanate hydrolysis products in particular, including SF, PEITC, erucin, and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC), have been reported as quinone reductase enzyme inducers.In this study, we hypothesize that the differences in glucosinolate composition between B. oleracea subspecies, as well as between the various tissues in a given subspecies, would correlate with changes in expression of genes associated with side-chain modifications. If we understand how this critical step of glucosinolate biosynthesis differs among various glucosinolate-containing plant species/subspecies and plant tissues, we may be able to manipulate glucosinolate composition for the benefit of the grower (reduced pest damage) or for human/animal health.The objectives of this study were to determine the composition of glucosinolates, their hydrolysis products, and health promoting bioactivity among different tissues from various broccoli and collards cultivars. In addition, comparison of the gene expression and glucosinolate profiles was performed in an effort to provide important information about the genetic regulatory mechanism that may be used to manipulate glucosinolate concentration for the improvement of human health promoting bioactivity or other agronomic purposes. In order to address these objectives, we used microfluidic high-throughput reverse-transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) analysis using the Fluidigm system.", "results": "Results and discussionGlucosinolate composition from various tissues of broccoli and collardAll five tested broccoli varieties showed similar tissue-dependent glucosinolate content differences, and mean total glucosinolate concentrations in root, floret, and leaf tissues of all tested five varieties were 37.8 mumol/g DW, 10.8 mumol/g DW, and 5.20 mumol/g DW, respectively (Fig 1A, 1B and 1C). There were variety-dependent variations in total glucosinolate concentrations in floret (ranged from 7.71 to 12.3 mumol/g DW), leaf (1.98 to 10.2 mumol/g DW), and root (28.5 to 59.1 mumol/g DW) tissues. Collards also showed tissue-dependent variation of total glucosinolate concentrations in all five tested varieties; the mean total glucosinolate concentration in collard roots was 48.9 mumol/g DW, which was over two-fold higher than that of collard leaf tissue (22.3 mumol/g DW) (Fig 1C and 1D).In addition to differences between tissues for total glucosinolates in both broccoli and collards, there was also notable variation for the type of glucosinolates found in the different tissues assayed. In the case of broccoli, the major glucosinolates in florets were glucobrassicin (3.59 mumol/g DW, 33.2% of total glucosinolate), glucoraphanin (3.05 mumol/g DW, 28.2% of total glucosinolate), and neoglucobrassicin (2.84 mumol/g DW, 26.3%), while glucobrassicin (2.50 mumol/g DW, 48.6%) and neoglucobrassicin (1.81 mumol/g DW, 35.1%) were the major constituents in leaf tissue. In roots, however, gluconasturtiin (16.93 mumol/g DW, 44.8%) and glucoerucin (9.79 mumol/g DW, 25.9%), which consisted of less than 1% of total glucosinolates in floret and leaf tissues, were the dominant forms. Previous research indicates that root tissues of several selected Brassica crops have significantly higher levels of certain glucosinolates, including glucoerucin and gluconasturtiin, than leaves of the same crops.In the case of collards, the total glucosinolate concentration in leaf and root tissues of the five tested accessions ranged 11.4 to 36.4 mumol/g DW and 28.6 to 62.6 mumol/g DW with average values of 22.3 mumol/g DW and 48.9 mumol/g DW, respectively. Similar to broccoli, collards also showed tissue-dependent differences in glucosinolate profiles in that glucobrassicin (10.9 mumol/g DW, 48.3% of total glucosinolate) and glucoraphanin (5.38 mumol/g DW, 24.1%) were the major glucosinolates in collard leaves, while gluconasturtiin (20.8 mumol/g DW, 42.6%) and glucoerucin (12.9 mumol/g DW, 26.3%) consisted of about 70% of total glucosinolates in collard roots.Glucosinolate composition of leaves and florets from the broccoli accessions were not distinctly different (Fig 2A). However, both broccoli and collards showed significantly different glucosinolate composition between aerial tissue (leaves and/or florets) and underground tissues (roots) (Fig 2A and 2C). A PCA score plot (Fig 2A) revealed that component 1 contributed to separation between aerial tissue and underground tissues for both broccoli (36.3%) and collard (46.3%). The PCA loading plot (Fig 2B) showed glucoerucin, gluconasturtiin, and several indole glucosinolates (4-methoxyglucobrassicin, 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin, and neoglucobrassicin) were positively associated with PCA component 1 in broccoli. These compounds also showed a similar association with PCA component 1 in collards (Fig 2D). Among tested broccoli varieties, 'VI-158' exhibited distinctive glucosinolate profiles in leaf and root tissues, where leaf tissues contained greater levels of glucobrassicin (6.53 mumol/g DW) and root tissues contained higher levels of gluconasturtiin (36.1 mumol/g DW) compared to the other varieties. 'Arcadia' broccoli showed the highest glucoraphanin concentration in florets; 'Neri' broccoli had the highest glucoiberin concentration in florets and lowest total glucosinolate concentration in leaf tissue.Among the five tested collard accessions, the glucosinolate profile of collard accession 'PI662840' was unique because it contained the highest concentration of sinigrin (27.3% of total glucosinolates) and lowest glucoraphanin (1.0% of total glucosinolates) in leaf tissue, compared to other accessions. The root of 'PI662840 displayed a comparatively high composition of sinigrin (14.7% of total glucosinolates) and low glucoerucin (6.4% of total glucosinolates) compared to other accessions. Collard accession 'PI181720' had significantly higher glucoerucin content in root tissue than other accessions. This accession also had the highest glucoraphanin concentration in leaf tissue. Thus, it was distinct in its PCA score (Fig 2C).Based upon their unique glucosinolate profiles (Fig 1) and PCA analysis results, three varieties of broccoli ('Neri', 'Arcadia', and 'VI-158') and three accessions of collards ('PI171531', 'PI181720', and 'PI662840') were selected for transcriptomic analysis.Glucosinolate hydrolysis product contentAs to be expected with the observed differences in glucosinolate profiles, extracts from different tissues of broccoli and collards also showed different profiles and concentrations of glucosinolate hydrolysis products (HPs; Fig 3). In the case of broccoli, the average total HP concentration in root tissue extracts (8.88 mumol/g DW) was higher than in those from florets (5.38 mumol/g DW) and leaves (0.61 mumol/g DW). The primary forms of HPs in broccoli floret tissues were SF and crambene, which consisted of 51.3% and 20.6% of total HPs, respectively. SF was the major HP in broccoli leaf and root tissue extracts (96.3% and 42.9%, respectively). Erucin (37.1%) and PEITC (14.8%) were major HPs in broccoli root tissue extracts, which differentiated roots from other tissues.In the case of collards, the average total hydrolysis product content in root tissue (19.08 mumol/g DW) was much higher than in leaves (9.93 mumol/g DW), the consumed portion of collard greens. On average, the major HPs in collard leaf tissue were SF (56.8%), goitrin (11.7%), crambene (11.7%), and iberin (10.1%), while erucin (32.2%), SF (20.2%), goitrin (15.1%), and crambene (12.4%) were major HPs in collard root tissue.For both broccoli and collards, relatively small amounts of PEITC (1.32 and 1.56 mumol/g DW,, respectively) were detected in root tissues compared to its precursor, gluconasturtiin (16.9 and 20.8 mumol/g DW, respectively) in the same tissues. This discrepancy is probably due to its lower solubility in water compared to other compounds, which has been previously reported. Although SF has a water solubility of 8.0 mg/mL, PEITC has only 0.051 mg/mL of water solubility. For by-product utilization, lack of water solubility of PEITC should be considered as an important factor. The primary glucosinolate HPs in broccoli and collard roots were erucin and PEITC. These volatile hydrolysis products in broccoli and collard roots may be associated with plant-pathogen soil interactions. A recent publication has reported that AITC altered soil microbial community composition. This suggests that non-synthetic anti-microbial agents can be developed from broccoli and collards root materials.For SF, conversion rate from glucoraphanin averaged 108% from floret and leaf tissues in broccoli and collard (n = 13, two very high outlying conversion rates were excluded due to very low glucoraphanin concentrations). Surprisingly conversion of glucoraphanin to SF was 213% from broccoli and collard roots. This is likely due to to the reported conversion of erucin to SF following hydrolysis. The conversion rate of glucoraphanin to SF (SF concentration / glucoraphanin concentration) was significantly correlated with glucoerucin concentration in root tissues from both broccoli and collard (r = 0.691, p = 0.027, n = 10). Previously, conversion of SF to erucin was reported as S-oxide reduction by reductase in gut bacteria. However, the interconversion mechanism from erucin to SF is currently unknown.Nitrile formation percentage was significantly different in the various broccoli tissues assayed (S3 Table). Floret tissues had an average of 30.6% of nitrile forms among all HPs, while leaf and root tissues had a significantly lower nitrile formation percentage (0 and 2.2%, respectively). Collard leaves and root tissues averaged 19.5% and 14% nitrile formation, respectively. It has been reported that broccoli florets have considerable ESP activity, which is associated with enhanced nitrile formation.Quinone reductase activityUnlike the prominent differences in glucosinolate and their HP concentrations, the QR inducing effects exhibited significant variation only between plant tissues, not between accessions. Extracts from root tissues of broccoli and collards were not significantly different from the QR inducing activity of broccoli florets and collard leaves, respectively (Fig 4). Relatively low QR inducing activity of root samples despite of high glucosinolate and HP concentration could be explained by volatility of HPs in root samples. As mentioned previously, PEITC and erucin have very low water solubility, which has been previously reported. Previous studies could not detect PEITC in hydrolyzed watercress extracts due to water solubility. Thus, only trace amounts of these compounds were likely dissolved in water hydrolysis extracts used for the QR assay, even though PEITC and erucin were well-extracted by conducting liquid to liquid solvent extraction for hydrolysis product analysis (Fig 3). This difference between QR inducing ability and glucosinolate/HP profile has been reported previously.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of bioactivity from broccoli and collard roots, since they are not typically consumed plant tissues. QR inducing activities of broccoli floret extracts were significantly higher than broccoli leaf extracts of all correspondant cultivars/accessions. QR inducing activity of collard leaf tissues was much higher than broccoli leaf tissues, even though they are both Brassica oleracea. The higher concentration of SF in collard leaf tissue may explain this difference in this QR inducing activity. Possibly, the different developmental stages of broccoli (reproductive stage) and collards (vegetative stage) when harvested affect glucosinolate accumulation in leaf tissues. Long-distance phloem transport of glucosinolates has been shown to occur in Arabidopsis. No data on glucosinolate accumulation in broccoli leaf tissue at various development stages could be found at this time, and therefore, more research is required to confirm this hypothesis.Significant correlations were found between precursor glucosinolates and their hydrolysis products (S4 Table). There were significant correlations between QR inducing activity and several phytochemicals, including: total aliphatic glucosinolates, r = 0.581, p = 0.023, n = 15; total glucosinolates, r = 0.592, p = 0.020, n = 15; SF, r = 0.597, p = 0.019, n = 15; and total isothiocyanates, r = 0.545, p = 0.017, n = 15. Of the glucosinolate HPs, SF is often reported to have the highest induction capability for Phase II antioxidant enzymes, including QR. However, Phase II induction has also been described for other isothiocyanate HPs (reviewed by Becker and Juvik, 2016), lending credence to the almost equally strong correlation between QR and total isothiocyanates seen in our results.Targeted transcriptomics of glucosinolate biosynthesis and hydrolysisIn an effort to better understand the transcriptional control of the glucosinolate biosynthetic mechanism, three broccoli and three collard cultivars were selected on the basis of their comparatively unique glucosinolate profiles and PCA results (Figs 1 and 2). From the heatmap (Fig 5A), gene expression patterns of each tissue type were distinct. Transcript abundance of ESM1, IPMI-SSU2, IPMDH1, AOP2, MAM3, MYB28.2, MYB122, MYB29, TGG2, NSP2, and UGT74C1 was significantly higher in root tissue than aerial tissues, while gene expression levels of ESP2, ESP, IPMI-SSU3, GGP1, FMOGS-OX2, and BCAT3 from root tissue were significantly lower than aerial tissues (by Tukey's HSD at 0.01; S5 Table). In addition, a leaf-specific higher gene expression pattern was observed for MYB34.2 CYP81F3, IGMT1, CYP81F1 compared to other tissues (by Tukey's HSD at 0.01; S5 Table). TGG1.2, IPMDH2, and MVP1 showed significantly higher gene expression in floret tissue compared to the other two tissues, while FMOGS-OX2 transcript was significantly more abundant in root tissue (by Tukey's HSD at 0.01; S5 Table).The gene expression data help to explain why roots contained high glucoerucin concentrations compared to leaves and florets, since these tissues displayed significantly lower expression levels of FMO GS-OX2 and FMO GS-OX5.1, genes which are responsible for the synthesis of glucoraphanin from glucoerucin (S5 Table). Moreover, high AOP2 gene expression explains relatively lower glucoraphanin concentration than glucoerucin in root (Fig 5A). Broccoli florets usually have high glucoraphanin levels, which indicates that FMOGS-OX and AOP2 are usually expressed at high and low levels, respectively, for the accumulation of glucoraphanin. The redundant homologs of FMOGS-OX were complementarily expressed in broccoli florets dependent on the broccoli variety. For example, 'Arcadia' and' VI-158' had high expression of FMOGS-OX5.1 rather than FMOGS-OX2, while 'Neri' and all three broccoli leaf tissues surveyed show the opposite pattern (Fig 5A). Higher gene expression levels of ESP in broccoli florets and ESP2 in broccoli leaf tissues with lower levels of ESM1 in leaf and floret compared to root tissues may explain the observed high nitrile formation percentage (S3 Table). The gene expression mean value of ESM1 in root tissue was 104 and 25-fold higher than floret and leaf tissues, respectively (calculated from relative quantification). The gene expression of ESP in root was 16-fold lower than floret tissue (calculated from relative quantification). There was a weak correlation between ESP gene expression and nitrile formation percentage (r = 0.490, p = 0.065, n = 15). However, there was significant correlation between ESM1 and ESP (r = -0.873, p<0.0001, n = 15) as well as between ESM1 and ESP2 (r = -0.806, p = 0.0003, n = 15). The weak correlation between nitrile formation and gene expression of ESP may be explained by the fact that ESM1 regulates ESP activity. Broccoli and collard roots appear to be an excellent source of active myrosinase without high ESP activity, ensuring high rates of SF formation from available glucoraphanin.These two genes were the top two variables of importance in projection (VIP) from the partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA, S6 Table). The VIP values of ESM1 and ESP were 1.87 and 1.71, respectively. VIP values greater than 0.8 make an important contribution to the dimensionality reduction involved in PLS compared to variables less than 0.8. Fourteen variables had a VIP value higher than 1.2 for broccoli tissue transcript abundance profiles (S6 Table). These could be useful transcript level biomarkers to indicate different broccoli tissues. Certain paralogous genes were expressed differently in various tissues (i.e, TGG1.2 and TGG2; IPMI-SSU2 and IPMI-SSU3; IPMDH1 and IPMDH2). As previously discussed, TGG1 and TGG2 have redundant function in glucosinolate hydrolysis and insect defense. TGG2 seems highly expressed in broccoli root compared to TGG1.2.In the case of collards, similarly, transcript abundance of MYB28.1, FMO GS-OX2, ESP2, ESP, IPMI-SSU3, GGP1, TGG1.2, MYB34.1, and MYB34.2 in collard root tissues were significantly lower compared to leaf tissue (by T-test at alpha = 0.01; S7 Table). Gene expression of TGG2, FMOGS-OX5.2, CYP81F4, IPMI-SSU2, MYB29, MAM3, AOP2, MYB122, ESM1, NSP2, and CYP81F4 in collard roots showed significantly greater transcript abundance compared to leaf tissue (by T-test at alpha = 0.01; S7 Table). To a slightly lesser extent, gene expression of IGMT2, CYP81F3, UGT74C1, FMOGS-OX5.2 was also significantly greater in collard root tissue compared to leaf tissue (by T-test at alpha = 0.05; S7 Table). Although FMOGS-OX5.2 was relatively highly expressed in root tissue, FMOGS-OX2 in roots was suppressed compared to leaf tissue (Fig 5B). This suggests that this may be the limiting factor in glucoerucin accumulation in collards. Unlike broccoli, FMOGS-OX5.2 may be a non-functional gene or not a contributing factor in the conversion of glucoerucin to glucoraphanin. VIP values of ESM1 and FMOGS-OX2 were 1.57 and 1.56, making them the top two genes, followed by ESP2 (VIP = 1.53). 16 variables in the collards data generated VIP values greater than 1.2 (S6 Table). Similar to the broccoli samples, certain paralogous genes were expressed differently in various tissues (i.e, TGG1.2 and TGG2; IPMI-SSU2 and IPMI-SSU3; FMOGS-OX2 and FMOGS-OX5.2).Gene expression of ESP2 was negatively correlated with QR activity (r = -0.829, p<0.0001, n = 15) while gene expression of ESM1 was positively correlated with QR activity (r = 0.551, p = 0.003, n = 15) (S4 Table). Total isothiocyanate concentration was positively correlated with the transcript abundance of glucosinolate side-chain elongation genes (MAM3, IPMDH1, BCAT4, and IPMI-SSU2), core structure formation genes (UGT74C1), transcription factors associated with aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis (MYB28.2 and MYB29), side chain modification genes (AOP2), and the myrosinase cofactor, ESM1. Total isothiocyanate concentration was negatively correlated with ESP2 (r = 0.607, p = 0.016, n = 15). Previously, it was reported that increased expression of MYB28 homologs achieved by the introgression of chromosomal segments from Brassica vilosa (a wild Brassica species) led to high accumulation of glucoraphanin in 'Beneforte', a recently released broccoli hybrid.For breeding purposes, high accumulation of glucoraphanin requires high expression of FMOGS-OX and low expression of AOP2 (Fig 6). For high glucoraphanin conversion to SF, high expression of ESM1 and low expression of ESP homologs is required. Thus, these genes should be considered as important biomarkers. In a previous study, RNAi knockout in Brassica juncea of AOP2, responsible for the conversion of glucoraphanin to other downstream glucosinolates, resulted in an increase in the concentration of glucoraphanin from approximately 0 mumole/g to greater than 40 mumole/gram in one transformant. Thus, comparison among various tissues that have distinct glucosinolate and transcriptional profiles may provide insight into how we may best be able to manipulate glucosinolate biosynthesis to produce valuable compounds in specific plant tissues.Using the Fluidigm system, we were able to measure gene expression for our selected target gene set (n = 45, without references genes) for 44 samples within 2 days with minimized human pipette error by utilizing microfluidic reaction. Note that a few sample spots were used for establishing a relative calibration curve for quantification. The Fluidigm system allows us to measure gene expression for a selected gene set (up to 96) and samples (up to 96) with far greater ease and speed compared to conventional RT-qPCR with 384 well microtiter plates. This system allows for a 50-100 fold reduction in the amount of material/reagents consumed, with 5 to 20 fold increased throughput compared to conventional single-plex RT-qPCR. Therefore, this system could be an excellent tool for scientists to conduct targeted transcriptomics research.Given our results, broccoli and collard roots can be good sources for glucosinolates with favorable molecular conditions for isothiocyanate production during hydrolysis by endogenous myrosinase, if desired (very low ESP activity and high ESM1 expression). There has been some research aimed at producing glucosinolates using a hairy root culture system with broccoli and Arabidopsis. A broccoli hairy root culture system with supplemented auxins has been shown to be more effective to produce indole glucosinolates compared Murashige and Skoog medium. These methods may be a more feasible practice to utilize root tissue for bioactive glucosinolate production. However, research using the broccoli hairy root culture system has focused on indole glucosinolate production, although we have shown broccoli roots to have high concentrations of gluconasturtiin and glucoerucin. Modifying the broccoli hairy root culture system to include production of these aromatic and aliphatic glucosinolates requires more research. Harvesting broccoli or collard roots for bioactive compound extraction may not be feasible due to harvest and labor costs. Broccoli and collard roots have many small or hairy roots, meaning only a portion of the root biomass is available for harvesting in the form of the taproot. Considering the harvesting and transporting of these by-products also requires labor and efforts, by-product utilization for on-site control of soil-born disease may be feasible utilization. In a previous study, broccoli residue incorporation into the soil effectively reduced Verticillium wilt incidence on cauliflower and eggplant. In order to utilize glucosinolates from root tissues for bioactive compound production, additional economic and logistic based research is needed to determine feasibility."}, "24586398": {"doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0088804", "title": "RNA-Seq Analysis of Transcriptome and Glucosinolate Metabolism in Seeds and Sprouts of Broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italic)", "abstract": "BackgroundBroccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica), a member of Cruciferae, is an important vegetable containing high concentration of various nutritive and functional molecules especially the anticarcinogenic glucosinolates. The sprouts of broccoli contain 10-100 times higher level of glucoraphanin, the main contributor of the anticarcinogenesis, than the edible florets. Despite the broccoli sprouts' functional importance, currently available genetic and genomic tools for their studies are very limited, which greatly restricts the development of this functionally important vegetable.ResultsA total of ~85 million 251 bp reads were obtained. After de novo assembly and searching the assembled transcripts against the Arabidopsis thaliana and NCBI nr databases, 19,441 top-hit transcripts were clustered as unigenes with an average length of 2,133 bp. These unigenes were classified according to their putative functional categories. Cluster analysis of total unigenes with similar expression patterns and differentially expressed unigenes among different tissues, as well as transcription factor analysis were performed. We identified 25 putative glucosinolate metabolism genes sharing 62.04-89.72% nucleotide sequence identity with the Arabidopsis orthologs. This established a broccoli glucosinolate metabolic pathway with high colinearity to Arabidopsis. Many of the biosynthetic and degradation genes showed higher expression after germination than in seeds; especially the expression of the myrosinase TGG2 was 20-130 times higher. These results along with the previous reports about these genes' studies in Arabidopsis and the glucosinolate concentration in broccoli sprouts indicate the breakdown products of glucosinolates may play important roles in the stage of broccoli seed germination and sprout development.ConclusionOur study provides the largest genetic resource of broccoli to date. These data will pave the way for further studies and genetic engineering of broccoli sprouts and will also provide new insight into the genomic research of this species and its relatives.", "intro": "IntroductionConsumption of fruits and vegetables has long been associated with better health and lower incidence of a variety of diseases such as coronary heart disease, cancers, etc. Notably, a diet rich in cruciferous vegetables especially broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) has been recognized as an efficient way to reduce the risk of getting many types of cancers. Epidemiological studies prior to 1996 showed an inverse relationship between cancer risk and cruciferous vegetable intake. Some newer studies demonstrate that this inverse relationship is mainly contributed by the breakdown products of glucosinolates. Glucosinolates are a major group of sulfur-rich secondary metabolites specifically in Cruciferae, which are well-known by their breakdown products to display several bioactivities, including plant defense against pathogens and insects as well as anticarcinogenesis in mammals. Based on their precursor amino acids, glucosinolates are divided into three major categories: aliphatic, indolic and aromatic glucosinolates. Among them, the degradation products of aliphatic glucosinolates are considered to have the higher phase 2 detoxication enzyme inducer ability than the other two groups which is effective in blocking chemical carcinogenesis; therefore, they are thought to be the main contributor to protection against carcinogenesis.Although broccoli heads are generally used as the edible part, the sprouts have been suggested to be a better source for health benefits. A study in 1997 reported the sprouts of eight broccoli cultivars have phase 2 enzyme inducer potency (nearly all arose from glucosinolates) 10-100 times greater than that of mature plants. During the first few days of germination, the inducer activity per unit plant weight declined from the maximum point in seeds in an exponential manner. The declining trend flattened after nine days, and finally approached the value in mature broccoli heads after about 15 days. The most valuable information is that in sprouts the aliphatic glucosinolates are dominant, while in adult plant the indolic ones account for the most. The high content of the aliphatic glucosinolates in broccoli sprouts is mainly attributed to glucoraphanin. Its hydrolytic product, sulforaphane, has been well studied with high anticancer activity. It can not only inhibit phase 1 enzymes but also induce phase 2 enzymes. Besides, sulforaphane has an important ability to target the highly aggressive cancer stem cell population, which is responsible for tumor therapeutics and cannot be eliminated by conventional chemo- or radio-therapy. Another interesting fact is that no significant side effects were found in therapy with sulforaphane in the rapeutic concentrations in non-malignant cells or mice. In addition, glucoraphanin has an obvious effect on decreasing oxidative stress, hypertension and inflammation in the cardiovascular system of rats. Based on these promising results, the first prospective clinical studies with cancer patients and sulforaphane-enriched broccoli sprouts have now been initiated in the United States. Therefore, broccoli sprouts should have played a more important role in human health than the mature inflorescences.The currently available genetic and genomic tools for broccoli research are very limited. While most studies of broccoli focused on physiology, few have been done at the genetic level and functional genomic studies are still in the infancy. Conspicuous effects of ESTs have been reported to develop genetic engineering, including gene family expansion, improving breeding programs by SNP and SSR markers, facilitating genome annotation, and large-scale expression analysis. Currently, only 2,324 broccoli ESTs in the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) are generated with the aim to identify gene expression profiles in microspore and floret bud. Most of them have no annotations. Despite of the growing demand and high-yield potential, the average yield of both fresh and processed broccoli has remained virtually unchanged in the United States in recent ten years. Thus, very limited genomic resources of broccoli constitute a key limitation to the development of improved crops. The advent of next generation sequencing technologies has triggered a revolution in biological research, for it is cheaper and more rapid in providing genomic and transcriptomic data.Here we performed a high-throughput Illumina Miseq sequencing to characterize the transcriptomes of five samples, including seeds, cotyledons of 3, 7, 11 day sprouts and euphyllas of 11 day sprouts. Since there is no available reference genome for broccoli, abundant short reads are required in order to perform de novo assembly. From the total of five libraries, we generated 557,094,098 raw reads with an average length of 251 bp containing 139,830,744,098 nucleotide bases. Formal research has suggested that to achieve 99% coverage of an mRNA, at least an 8X sequencing depth is required. For this study, the sequencing depth is 50X, enough to get the maximum coverage. Using a de novo assembly method, 19,441 unigenes are obtained with an average length of 2133 bp. These unigenes are used for subsequent annotation analyses to provide a platform of transcriptome information for genes in broccoli sprouts. In this study, we focused our work on identification of glucosinolate metabolism genes in broccoli seed germination and sprout development. This will pave the way for further genetic engineering to improve this species' agronomic traits.", "results": "Results and DiscussionSequencing and Data AnalysisRNA sequencing of the five samples (seeds, 3 day cotyledons, 7 day cotyledons, 11 day cotyledons and 11 day euphyllas) produced a total of ~85million 251 bp paired-end reads with an average of 17million reads for each sample. Cleaning and quality checks were performed to the raw data (cf. Materials and Methods). A total of ~75million trimmed reads were obtained with useful data percentage in five time points ranging from 70.29% to 76.01% and the average length of each read was 207 bp (Table S1). Compared to the reads generated by the formal platforms, the longer length of Illumina Miseq sequencing reads greatly facilitated the accuracy of the subsequent de novo assembly. Using single k-mer assembler Velvet (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet), assembly of reads generated 659,752 contigs with mean sizes of 254 bp and N50 of 222 bp (Table 1). The contigs with length more than 500 bp accounted for about 6.19%. Multiple K-mer assembler OASES (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/oases) was applied to produce 122,345 transcripts for 40,081 loci with average length of 1670 bp. Then, all the transcripts were blasted against the Arabidopsis database. For those \"non-BLASTable\" transcripts, we searched them against the NCBI non-redundant (nr) database, using BLASTx program with an E-value threshold of 1E-5. A total of 94,255 (77.04%) transcripts were significantly matched to known genes in Arabidopsis and 3,971 (3.25%) transcripts were matched to the nr database. The high percentage of transcripts matched to Arabidopsis database is due to the close relation of these two species. For the transcripts representing the same loci, the top hit ones were clustered as unigenes. Finally, 19,441 unigenes were generated, with the average length of 2,133 bp and ranging in size from 200 bp to 20,580 bp (Table 1). The size distribution of contigs, transcripts and unigenes were compiled (Figure S1). The sequencing data has been deposited into NCBI gene expression omnibus (GEO) and the accession number is GSE53298.Variable efficiency of matching to sequences in the databases was found in assembled sequences of different lengths, with longer sequences showing higher match proportions (Figure S2). For sequences longer than 1500 bp, the match efficiency was 98.24%. But for sequences between 200-500 bp and 500-1000 bp in length, it was just 53.40% and 79.17%, respectively. E-value distribution of the top hits in the databases had shown 71.17% of matched sequenced with strong homology (<1.0e-50) (Figure 1). 30.54% of the transcripts had a similarity higher than 80%, while 46.47% showed similarity between 60%-80% in identity distribution pattern. The total 77.01% of the transcripts showing identity higher than 60% along with the high quality e-value distribution supported the reliability of the de novo assembly performed in the study.Annotation and ClassificationSince biologists have recognized that there is likely to be a single limited universe of genes and proteins are conserved in most, if not all living cells, the GO (gene ontology) Consortium was created as a joint project of many organism databases to produce a structured, precisely defined, common, controlled vocabulary for describing the functions of genes and gene products in any organisms. To annotate the broccoli transcriptome, GO terms were assigned to broccoli unigenes based on their identity to known protein sequences in the Arabidopsis database and nr database. 19,441 unigenes were assigned to 47 functional groups with 134,938 functional terms using GO assignments (Figure 2). For the three main categories of GO classification scheme, the assignments to the \"biological process\" (61,583, 45.64%) made up the majority, followed by the \"cellular component\" (53,030, 39.30%) and the \"molecular function\" (20324, 15.06%). Among these GO groups, the high number of unigenes putatively involved in \"cellular process\" (11,129) and \"metabolic process\" (10,230) in the biological process category indicated that the broccoli tissues used in this study were undergoing exquisite metabolic activities, which coincided with the samples' status. Interestingly, 5,220 unigenes were assigned to \"response to stimulus\", showed that during the germination of broccoli seeds and the development of sprouts, there were some protective mechanisms for preparing for potential external and/or internal stresses. Under the category of cellular component, the \"cell\", \"cell part\" and \"organelle\" were prominent groups. It is noteworthy that the unigenes were not gathered into few groups but were generally expressed. This might be due to the widespread requirements during seedling development.EggNOG (evolutionary genealogy of genes: Non-supervised Orthologous Groups) is a database providing orthologous groups for 943 Bacteria, 69 Archaea and 121 Eukaryotes. According to the previous report, the proteins could be divided into 25 functional categories. Out of 19,441 unigenes with significant identity with Arabidopsis database and nr database in this study, 11,242 could be classified into 24 eggNOG categories with only \"Nuclear structure\" having no annotated unigenes (Figure S3). The categories \"function unknown\" (2,088, 18.57%) and \"general function prediction only\" (2,050, 18.24%) were the two largest functional groups of the 25 eggNOG categories. The high percentage of unigenes classified into \"general function prediction only\" coincided with the transcriptome studies of other species. But our newly noticed fact that so many unigenes were assigned to unknown functional group might indicate there are some interesting unknown mechanism during germination of broccoli seeds and the development of sprouts. Following the most abundant two groups were \"transcription\" (929, 8.26%), \"replication\", \"recombination and repair\" (802, 7.13%), \"signal transduction mechanisms\"(797, 7.09%) and \"posttranslational modification, protein turnover, chaperones\"(680, 6.05%), whereas the two groups involving \"cell motility\" and \"extracellular structures\" consisted of a total of 10 unigenes (0.09%), representing the smallest eggNOG classifications. Noteworthily, 277 unigenes (2.64%) were classified into secondary metabolite biosynthesis group, including glucosinolate biosynthesis in broccoli sprouts.The KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) is a database linking genomic information with higher order functional information by collecting manually drawn pathway maps representing current knowledge on cellular processes and standardized gene annotations. A total of 9836 genes were classified into six main categories including 38 secondary pathways (Figure S4) in the five tested samples. \"Metabolism\" is the biggest category (3,624, 36.84%), followed by \"human disease\" (1,760, 17.89%), \"Genetic Information Processing\" (1,674, 17.02%), \"Organismal Systems\" (1,279, 13.00%) and \"Cellular Processes\" (909, 9.24%), whereas \"environmental information processing\" (590, 6.00%) containing only 3 sub-units (\"membrane transport\", \"signal transduction and signaling molecules and interaction\") was the smallest category. These results indicated that the broccoli sprouts were undertaken active metabolic and genetic processes and the functional classification of KEGG provided a valuable resource for investigating specific processes and pathways in broccoli sprouts.Gene Expression PatternGene expression patterns can provide important clues as to the roles of unknown genes in biological active processes. While RPKM (reads aligned to gene per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads) was widely used to calculate gene expression values, we used a more accurate method called DESeq to estimate gene expression values in this analysis to infer differential expression signals with good statistical power. K-means clustering analysis was performed using the software MeV edition 4.90 (http://www.tm4.prg/mev.html) to group unigenes with similar expression patterns under different time points and resulting in 10 different clusters (Figure 3). The most abundant cluster (IX) contained 3,659 genes with highest expression at the very beginning (i.e. seeds) and then their expression levels were down-regulated all through the development of sprouts, and reached the lowest point at the 11D euphyllas. These genes might greatly and specifically contribute to seed germination. Cluster I, II, III, VI and VIII comprised genes whose expression levels were very low in seeds but peaked at any one of the three points in cotyledons. Also, genes in cluster IV showed the highest expression level at 11D euphyllas with relatively low level at other time points.In order to identify differentially expressed genes between the five types of samples, we compared them with each other and picked out a total of 2675 genes, which were at least 2-fold up- or down-regulated between two samples with p-value smaller than 0.05. Then, hierarchical cluster was generated to gain a global view of the differential expressed genes (Figure 4). Obviously, the 11 day cotyledons showed closer relationship with the 11 day euphyllas than with the cotyledons of other time points. This indicated the similar function between the initial stage of euphyllas and the late stage of cotyledons. As expected, the three time points of cotyledons were more similar to each other than to seeds. Even though the 7th day is the mid-point of 3rd day and 11th day, the expression profile of 7 day cotyledons was more similar to that of 11 day cotyledons than that of 3 day cotyledons. This fact along with the big difference between seeds and 3 day cotyledons illustrated the 3 day might be the special point in broccoli sprout development.Putative Transcription FactorsTranscription factors (TFs) have been considered as one of the most important functional elements regulating gene expression that leads to developmental and other changes. It has been reported that in response to internal or external environment changes, TF genes exhibit more rapid expression changes than the bulk of the regulated genes. Thus, the expression profile of TF genes may in some way reflect the subsequent transcription activities regulated by them. For their important roles, the key putative TFs involved in broccoli seed germination and sprout development were analyzed.A study in 2003 has revealed that in Arabidopsis, most (84%) of TFs could be detected in six day old seedlings. Currently, the Plant Transcription Factor Database (PlnTFDB) contains 2451 and 2162 distinct TF sequences from Arabidopsis and Arabidopsis lyrata, respectively, arranged in 81 families. In the sequenced broccoli seeds and sprouts, 78 TF families including 1,633 putative TF genes had been identified with the five most expressed TF families being AP2-EREBP, bHLH, MYB, HB and C3H (Table S2). A total of 1,581 of the 1,633 genes accounting for 86.82% were annotated with sequences from the close related species Arabidopsis and Arabidopsis lyrata.The biggest TF family in our study of broccoli seeds and sprouts was AP2-EREBP with 109 putative family members being detected. AP2-EREBP family is unique to plants and characterized by a conserved AP2 DNA-binding domain of about 60 amino acids. AP2-EREBP genes have been found to play important roles throughout the life cycle including regulating several developmental processes especially leaf epidermal cell identity and forming part of the mechanisms used to respond to stress. Some members of AP2-EREBP, like AP2, control seed mass and seed size in Arabidopsis which is very important to extended growth of cotyledons. The significantly large number of AP2-EREBP family members expressed in broccoli seeds and sprouts indicated the important function of these genes in this period as previously reported in other species.The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family members are involved in various process of seedling development such as light signaling, brassinosteroid and abscisic acid signaling, flavonoid biosynthesis, axillary meristem formation, stomatal patterning and trichome differentiation. 99 unigenes identified to have bHLH-like sequences formed the second biggest TF family in the tested samples. Light is one of the most important elements in seed germination and seedling development, a subfamily containing 15 members are involved in light signaling. These bHLH proteins are known as PIF (phytochrome interacting factor) or PIL (phytochrome interacting factor-like). These proteins play important roles in phytochrome signal transduction by interacting with phytochromes. Our study found that putative orthologs of bHLH56, PIF1, PIF3, PIF4, PIF5, PIL1, PIF7, SPT were expressed in broccoli seed germination and sprout development, suggesting their similar roles in light signaling during this period. SPATULA (SPT) was found as a leaf size regulator. The SPT ortholog in broccoli sprouts showed highest expression level in the cotyledons of 3 day sprouts, indicating its possible regulation activity on cotyledon size in early broccoli sprouts.The MYB TFs contain varying numbers of MYB domain repeats to bind DNA. The function of MYB proteins have been well studied in a variety of plant species to be involved in regulatory networks controlling development, metabolism and responses to biotic and abiotic stresses in Arabidopsis . In Arabidopsis seedlings, MYB115 and MYB118 play important roles in embryogenesis. MYB38 and MYB18 have been proposed to regulate hypocotyls elongation in response to blue and far-red light, respectively. Also, the MYB17 has shown activity in regulating seed germination. Some other MYB proteins are involved in the control of cell wall biosynthesis like MYB58, MYB63, MYB85, MYB68 and MYB46. In this study, a total of 84 putative MYB genes were detected including those orthologs involved in Arabidopsis seedling development. The many putative MYB TF genes expressed in the broccoli seed and sprouts indicated this important family also plays important roles in regulating the biological process during seed germination and sprout development.Sixty-seven putative NAC TF family members were identified in seed and sprouts of broccoli. The large NAC transcription factor family has been implicated in a variety of plant developmental processes in many species including Arabidopsis and soy bean etc. However, the molecular mechanisms of the family members are still unknown even in well studied species. It has been suggested that they have the ability to enable crosstalk between different pathways. Cys2His2 (C2H2)-type zinc finger proteins are a group of widespread eukaryotic TFs. A majority of C2H2 zinc finger proteins are regarded as trans regulators of genes playing important roles in development, differentiation and suppression of malignant cell transformation. In the sequenced tissues, 65 putative C2H2 zinc finger genes were identified.Several other TF families were also found like 61 members in bZIP, 54 members in WRKY, 14 members in ARF, etc. Because of the importance of TFs in regulating the downstream genes in variety of pathways, further investigation of the putative TFs would provide interesting clues to the variety of activities in seed germination and sprout development of broccoli.Glucosinolate Metabolic PathwaysThe high contents of glucosinolates especially the much higher content of aliphatic glucosinolates in broccoli sprouts compared to mature tissues have attracted attention in past decade. The biological basis of this trait especially whether the glucosinolate metabolic genes in Arabidopsis or Brassica rapa have the same functions in broccoli sprouts, remains an open question. In this study, a total of 36 unigenes were annotated as putative genes involved in aliphatic and indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis, degradation and regulation. By comparing these unigenes with the CDS of Arabidopsis ones and setting the identity cutoff of 60%, we abandoned 11 unigenes and finally got 25 putative broccoli glucosinolates metabolic genes sharing 62.04-89.72% nucleotide sequence identity with the Arabidopsis orthologs (Figure 5, Table 2).The glucosinolate biosynthesis proceeds through three independent stages: chain elongation (for aliphatic glucosinolates), core structure formation and side chain modification (Figure 5). For the 25 selected putative genes, 7 were uniquely involved in the aliphatic pathway including BoIPMDH3, BoBCAT3, BoCYP83A1, BoGSTF11, BoSOT17, BoFMOGS-OX2 and BoFMOGS-OX5. In the chain elongation stage, two genes (BoIPMDH3, BoBCAT3) were detected. BCAT3 encodes a chloroplast branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase and IPMDH3 is one of the three isopropylmalate dehydrogenase genes in Arabidopsis whose isozyme IPMDH1 has been characterized as a functional gene involved in aliphatic glucosinolate chain elongation process. Most of the Arabidopsis genes involved in biosynthesis of aliphatic glucosinolate core structure have orthologs expressed in the studied tissues except for CYP79F1, CYP79F2 and UGT74B1, UGT74C1 (Figure 5). It has been reported that in the double-knockout Arabidopsis mutant of CYP79F1 and CYP79F2, aliphatic glucosinolate biosynthesis is completely abolished, meaning that CYP79F1 and CYP79F2 are necessary for the pathway. The contradiction between the high level of aliphatic glucosinolate content and the missing of both of CYP79F1 and CYP79F2 indicates that there may be unknown gene(s) performing the same function in broccoli sprouts. FMOGS-OX2 and FMOGS-OX5 are important genes performing S-oxygenation in side chain modification stage in Arabidopsis , they may have the same function in broccoli. However, orthologs of other genes of this stage expressed in Arabidopsis have not been identified in our tissues. Notably, glucoraphanin is one of the products produced by FMOGS-OX2 . The missing of the downstream genes of FMOGS-OX2 may explain the accumulation of glucoraphanin in broccoli sprouts.In broccoli seeds and sprouts, the indolic glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway showed a high colinearity with Arabidopsis. Eight genes involved in the indolic pathway were detected with BoCYP79B2, BoCYP79B3, BoCYP83B1 and BoGSTF10 in core structure formation and BoCYP81F4, BoCYP81F1, BoCYP81F3 and BoIGMT1 in side chain modification. The enzyme UGT74B1 transforming the Indolylmethyl-thiohydroximate to the Indolylmethyl-desulfoglucosinolate in the indolic glucosinolate pathway was missing. In Arabidopsis, when the indolylmethyl-glucosinolates were formed, there were two ways for them to be modified. Part of them would be transformed to 1-methoxy-3indolylmethyl-glucosinolates by CYP81F4 and the others would be transformed to 4-methoxy-3indolylmethyl-glucosinolates by CYP81F1, CYP81F2 or CYP81F3 and then the IGMT1 or IGMT2 would modify them to 4-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl-glucosinolates. The CYP81F2 and IGMT2 were not detected in this study.Beside these genes uniquely expressed in indolic or aliphatic glucosinolate pathway, the three genes involved in both the two pathways including GGP1, SUR1 and SOT18 were all identified in the studied tissues too. In Arabidopsis, TSB1 is a tryptophan synthesis gene and GSH1 is a crucial gene to form GSH, which is considered as the sulfur donor to be conjugated with the activated aldoxime. The orthologs in broccoli with these two genes not involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis directly but having important roles for the forming of glucosinolates were also identified.Some transcription factors of MYB family are crucial in regulating glucosinolate biosynthesis pathways of Arabidopsis, in which MYB28, MYB29 and MYB76 are involved in aliphatic glucosinolates biosynthesis whereas MYB51, MYB34 and MYB 122 could strongly enhance the expression of indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis genes. In broccoli seeds and sprouts, only BoMYB29 and BoMYB51 were detected.In the glucosinolate degradation pathways, the PEN2, TGG1 and TGG2 were well studied in Arabidopsis. PEN2 was reported to cleave indolic glucosinolates as a myrosinase. TGG1 and TGG2 were two important myrosinases identified long time ago. The double mutant of these two genes showed nearly no aliphatic glucosinolate degradation but only reduced indolic glucosinolate myrosinase activity. In addition, the tgg1tgg2 double mutant still exhibited a wild type callose response to fungi simulation which required the degradation products of indolic glucosinolates. These facts indicated the TGG1 and TGG2 mainly degrade the aliphatic glucosinolates and had slight effects on indolic ones. In the sequenced tissues, the three myrosinase genes' orthologs were all identified.It is interesting to note that the expression levels of many broccoli glucosinolate related genes were expressed higher in sprouts than in seeds. Some previous studies had indicated the glucosinolate concentration decreased exponentially after germination. This contradiction between the decreased concentration level of glucosinolates and the increased level of biosynthesis genes might due to the high consumption of glucosinolates and this dramatic degradation of glucosinolates possibly played an important role in the stage of broccoli seed germination and sprout development.Besides, the putative genes involved in indolic glucosinolate synthesis have higher expression levels than those involved in aliphatic glucosinolate synthesis in general. This was more obvious in the expression of TFs. The only identified transcription factor BoMYB29 in aliphatic glucosinolate synthesis had no expression in seeds and 11 day cotyledons; in the other three time points, the expression level was also relatively low (Table 2). The expression values of BoMYB51 were much higher compared to the expression of BoMYB29. Furthermore, we noticed that the expression value of BoTGG2, was 45-fold higher in 3 day cotyledons than in seeds (Table 2). The expression value decreased slowly along with the development of sprouts and got to the lowest point in the 11 day cotyledons, which was still about 21-fold higher than that in seeds. Notably, at the time of 11th day, the expression values of BoTGG2 in the new forming euphyllas astonishingly increased to about 130-fold. While the expression values of the indolic glucosinolate degradation gene BoPEN2 were relatively low compared to those of BoTGG2 and not too much different in our sequenced tissues except for the 11 day cotyledons (Table 2). These results demonstrated that in glucosinolate sprouts, the exponentially decreased levels of glucosinolates were mainly due to the degradation of aliphatic glucosinolates especially in the young stage of tissues, while the indolic glucosinolates might be constantly synthesized and stored. The exception was the expression value of BoPEN2 in late stage cotyledons increased to 10-fold higher than that in seeds. This might indicate the degraded indolic glucosinolates had special roles at the old stage of cotyledons.Actually, previous studies have reported that the expression of TGG1, redundantly functioning with TGG2 in Arabidopsis, is higher in young developing tissues than older tissues and PEN2 is unlikely to function in glucosinolate turnover during seedling development, which are coordinated to our results. Degraded glucosinolates have been proposed to regulate the cellular signaling in response to abiotic stress which is based on the observation that TGG1 is highly enriched in stomatal guard cells and regulate the stomatal opening or closing by affecting the ABA and MeJA signaling. So the myrosinases' high level in young seedling may be necessary for proper protection due to lower physical strength barriers. In our study, BoTGG2 was the predominantly expressed myrosinase rather than TGG1 in Arabidopsis. Considering that TGG1 and TGG2 redundantly function in glucosinolate degradation, the predominantly functional gene may be BoTGG2 in broccoli sprouts instead of BoTGG1. Also, glucosinolates has been suggested to represent up to 30% of total sulfur content of plant organs and glucosinolate content has been observed to decrease during sulfur deprivation. So we can hypothesis that the enriched degradation products of glucosinolates may contribute greatly to the defense system as a compensation for the lower physical strength barrier in broccoli sprouts and they may also play an important role as potential sulfur donor during broccoli seed germination and sprout development.ConclusionIn this study, we performed a transcriptome sequencing of seeds, 3 day, 7 day and 11 day cotyledons and 11day euphyllas to identify the transcripts and quantify their levels of expression in broccoli seed germination and sprout developments. In total, we obtained 19441 unigenes annotated by homologs with sequences in the public databases. 2675 genes differentially expressed between any two of the five samples and 1,633 putative TFs were detected. These genes may be closely related to the seed germination and sprout development in broccoli. Twenty-five unigenes with high identity to Arabidopsis glucosinolate metabolic genes have been investigated. This established a high colinearity between Arabidopsis and broccoli in glucosinolate metabolic pathways for further studies. In addition, expression analysis of these glucosinolate metabolic genes showed contradiction between the increased expression of the candidate synthesis genes and the previously reported decreased concentration of glucosinolate content after germination. The ortholog of TGG2, which mainly degrade aliphatic glucosinolates in Arabidopsis, expressed astonishingly higher after germination. These results indicate the breakdown products of glucosinolates may play important roles in the stage of broccoli seed germination and sprout development. The results here represent the largest genetic resource for broccoli and will provide new insight into the genomic research of this species and its relatives."}, "26343628": {"doi": "10.3390/molecules200915748", "title": "Antigenotoxicity and Tumor Growing Inhibition by Leafy Brassica carinata and Sinigrin", "abstract": "Cruciferous vegetables are well known and worldwide consumed due to their health benefits and cancer prevention properties.

IntroductionThere is a wide range of variation with respect to the properties of the botanical products used by humans. The active principles of vegetables constitute nowadays the basis of most pharmacological substances. In this sense, consumers not only appreciate vegetables for their nutritional value, but also for their contents in compounds that produce benefits for human health. For this reason, the analysis of the possible antimutagenic, anticarcinogenic and anti-aging activity of a botanical nutraceutical substance is essential as a tool to distinguish between medicines and simply healthy products.Many beneficial properties have been attributed to cruciferous vegetables (i.e., broccoli, cabbage, Brussels sprouts and cauliflower). Specifically, numerous members of the Brassicaceae family are commercialized for animal and human consumption around the world as a rich source of nutrients and also, as healthy products.Glucosinolates (beta-thioglucoside-N-hydroxysulphates, GLSs) are naturally occurring thioglucosides that are characteristic of the Brassicaceae (including the genus Brassica) and related family in the order Capparales. These compounds remain inactive until hydrolysed to numerous compounds (thiocyanates, thiones, indoles, nitriles, etc.) which possess diverse biological activities as biocides by myrosinase enzymes (thioglucosidase). They are also known to possess anti-nutritional properties although produce different effects in humans in function of their chemical structure and concentration in the plant. Both vary considerably depending on the species, stage of development, type of tissue and environmental conditions, making the determination of harmful and beneficial effects in human nutrition a difficult task.Brassica carinata A. Braun, commonly known as Ethiopian mustard or Abyssinian mustard, belongs to the Brassicaceae family and is a traditional African vegetable, previously gathered from the wild for human consumption. It is cultivated as an oil and leafy vegetable plant in the Ethiopian highlands at altitudes between 1500 and 2600 m. It is known as yabesha gomen in Amharic and also used in East and Southern Africa as accompaniment for ugali (a type of porridge made from maize or millet flour). B. carinata is an annual plant with many desirable traits for commercialization: high yielding and rusticity, edible leaves, resistance to disease and low chemical input requirement. The plant may be eaten whole and possess a higher nutrient composition than other dietary species like white cabbage and spinach.The predominant GLS in B. carinata is sinigrin, but its concentration depends on different factors, such as genotype, tissues and plant age. Sinigrin hydrolysis catalyzed by myrosinase enzymes produces isothiocyanates (ITCs) as bioactive products, specifically allyl-ITCs (AITC) whose anticancer activity has been proved by several authors. It has been confirmed that even short-term intake of ITC-containing vegetables might be associated with reduced cancer risk in human in vitro and in vivo systems.Epidemiological studies highlight that the present consumption rate of this vegetables has benefits for human health even more than diets rich in fruits and other vegetables. However, in vivo and in vitro experiments show variable results depending on the species, and GLS type and content seem to be the key. The present work is based on the need to clarify the balance of adverse and beneficial effects of cruciferous plants already selected for their desirable traits. This is the case of tested plant, the leaves of B. carinata, which has been used to determine the antimutagenic and antiproliferative capacities of plant samples and its major GLS sinigrin, as well as the concentrations and time at which their health benefit appears. The Drosophila melanogaster in vivo animal model and the HL60 in vitro cell-line model were used for these two purposes.", "results": "2. Results and DiscussionDepending on nutrient content, vegetables are categorized into five groups and cruciferous plants fall into two of them: the dark-green and the other vegetables categories, being the dark-green one of the main recommended group for human intake. Information about vegetables and diet, including how much of these foods should be eaten daily or weekly is available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) website Choose My Plate.Due to the large variety among cruciferous species and the high variability of their compound content, the daily human intake of Brassica sp. and GLSs is difficult to estimate. During the past decades, commercial varieties of broccoli have been consumed as most popular Brassica species in a range of 2-8 grams per day around the world, much less than those recommended for total vegetable intake. Also, the corresponding daily GLSs intake in humans is very variable depending on countries and populations, as well as consumed varieties, but it has been estimated to be in the order of milligrams. Despite the great amount of works and studies about this topic, nowadays there are no specific recommendations for only Brassica intake apart from those for general vegetables. However, a current intake assessment conducted by Spherix indicated that the mean and 90th percentile consumption of 16.4 and 50.9 grams per day, respectively, is less than one serving of vegetables (one serving of raw broccoli is 36 g; one serving of cooked broccoli is 78 g. Taking into account the average daily food intake of D. melanogaster (between three to five times its own weight) and its average body weight (1 mg), the concentration ranges assayed for both B. carinata and sinigrin falls within this consumption rate.2.1. Leaf Glucosinolate Content DeterminationThe HPLC chromatogram of the analysed leaf samples is shown in Figure 1. Only two GLSs were detected: sinigrin (2-propenyl-GLS) (10.05 micromol g-1 of dry weight, DW) and glucobrassicin (3-indolylmethyl-GLS), the last one in small amounts (0.14 micromol g-1 DW). The total GLS content found in the leaves of the B. carinata line (Bc-IASC1) was 10.19 micromol g-1 DW (equivalent to 101.9 micromol per 100 g fresh weight). Our data for GLS and sinigrin content in B. carinata are in accordance with previous determination in leaves at the same growth stage and resulting sinigrin the major and almost sole GLS presented.2.2. In Vivo Assays2.2.1. Toxicity AssaysTable 1 shows B. carinata plant and sinigrin sample toxicity expressed as percentage of emerged treated adults respect to the negative control emerged adults (survival control corrected). All treatments at all assayed concentrations affected D. melanogaster survival with values between 19.33% and 78.22%, both for sinigrin 1.2 mM in combined and simple treatments respectively. Simple treatments produced a larvae survival around 50% (LC50), which represents normal value in experiments performed to evaluate toxicity levels.Our results are in agreement with those found before in which ITCs were toxic for coleopteran eggs, showing that lethal concentration (LC90) of these compounds were 1.8 to 5.6 microg mL-1 depending on ITC type, being AITC less toxic than aromatic-ITCs.Regarding B. carinata plant samples, the survival average was 52.07% and 34.89% for simple and combined treatments, respectively. This reduction of survival (~18%) is explained by the addition of H2O2 to the medium (combined treatment) as a potent toxic agent. This H2O2 effect was also observed in sinigrin treatments were survival average was 38.11% in combined against 68.27% simple treatments (~30% survival reduction).In simple treatments, sinigrin showed a less toxic effect than B. carinata samples at all tested concentrations. This fact could be explained by the complex composition of plant samples when compared with single compounds. In this sense, B. carinata plant possesses anti-nutrients such as phytates, phenolics, and tannins which can affect individual survival.In combined treatments, B. carinata addition had no significant effect on D. melanogaster survival so that the number of emerged adults was similar to those of positive control (H2O2 treatment survival = 37.78%) although some synergistic but not additive effect of H2O2 and B. carinata products is found in concentrations of 2.5 and 5 mg mL-1. Contrarily, sinigrin addition to the medium counteracted H2O2 toxicity at the highest assayed concentrations (2.4 and 4.81 mM) but, this effect of detoxification did not appeared at low sinigrin concentrations (0.6 and 1.2) in which the toxic effect was higher, reducing the number of emerged adults (25.56% and 19.33% of survival, respectively).In general, no dose effect was observed except in sinigrin combined treatments in which the lesser survival percentage (19.33%) corresponded to a concentration of 1.2 mM and the highest percentage (60.22%) to the highest concentration assayed (4.81 mM). Other concentrations could be assayed in order to determine a dose effects in tested samples but they would not be relevant for human consumption.2.2.2. Genotoxicity AssaysDirect studies on the toxicity and genotoxicity of B. carinata fresh plant are not available because the epidemiological data always shows protective anticancer health properties. The present study on the genotoxicity of B. carinata is the first that has confirmed the epidemiological references probing that B. carinata plant did not exert any DNA damage in the mwh/flr eukaryotic system of D. melanogaster.Due to the antioxidant capacity of B. carinata and sinigrin, H2O2 has been selected as oxygen free radical generator in this work. This compound has been showed as a potent mutagen by producing highly reactive hydroxyl radicals ( OH). Thus, the present work has tried to prove the antioxidant capacity of tested samples which could act as antimutagens avoiding DNA damage produced by H2O2.Table 2 shows the results of H2O2 genotoxic activity, as a positive control, both in marker-heterozygous and in balancer-heterozygous wings. H2O2 has been selected as a positive control due to its proved oxidative genotoxic activity in the SMART being able to induce somatic mutation and mitotic recombination. Our results are consistent with this showing that H2O2 increased small single and total spots. The genotoxic results for H2O2 validate the assay as an appropriate system for screening mutagens (positive controls as H2O2) and non-mutagens (distilled-sterile water controls or safe plants).The genotoxicity results obtained in the SMART of D. melanogaster for B. carinata and sinigrin are summarized in Table 2. No sample was mutagenic at any tested concentration. Contrarily they produce total mutation rates lower than those of the negative control at any dose, with an average of 0.18 and 0.15 spots per wing in the B. carinata and sinigrin experiments respectively. In this sense, food metabolism products generate free radicals in cells such as oxygen and nitrogen reactive species which produce mutations. In SMART, these mutations are scored in negative control and they are due to larva feeding of standard Carolina medium. Any addition to this medium can increase (i.e., the mutagen used, H2O2) or decrease this mutation range (free radical scavenger) which is the case of assayed samples, so our plant and molecule samples produce a mutation rate lower than negative control, acting as antimutagens against larva medium.This non-genotoxic effect found in D. melanogaster are useful data to consider the inclusion of B. carinata in human diet even more than other Brassica spp. more popular and worldwide consumed i.e., broccoli (B. oleracea L. var. italica) which raw, freeze-dried market plants lead to an increase in genotoxicity in this in vivo test. In this sense, some recent studies gave rise to the concern that broccoli and other commercial varieties possess genotoxic activity due to their content in DNA damaging constituents such as certain types of GLSs. Contrarily, we have not found this undesirable effect in our tested plant B. carinata, a fact that would reinforce the proposal for using it as a dietary source and makes this species more appropriate for human intake than its close relatives. The different GLS profiles found in Brassica spp. may be the responsible for this apparent discrepancy, as sinigrin is a minor GLS constituent in such a species and contrarily, it is the main GLS in B. carinata.Our results on the lack of genotoxicity of sinigrin are in concordance with previous studies showing that sinigrin is neither genotoxic nor cytotoxic in the in vitro hamster ovary cell line (CHO) system. These authors also showed that AITC are not genotoxic at high cytotoxic doses as opposed to phenethyl-ITCs (breakdown products containing an aromatic functional group). Nevertheless, sinigrin induced chromosome aberrations but not sister chromatid exchanges at concentrations of 2 mg mL-1. On the other hand, toxicity tests performed in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans concluded that sinigrin is non-toxic up to the concentration 80 g L-1 and the addition of myrosinase increased sinigrin toxicity (LC50 = 0.5 g L-1). The same experiment performed directly with AITC resulted in a lethal concentration value of 0.04 g L-1.2.2.3. Antigenotoxicity AssaysThe results obtained for antigenotoxicity assays are a contribution to the health properties of B. carinata and sinigrin in DNA protection. Analysed samples showed that this plant behaves as a desmutagen by reducing the apparition of mutations in comparison with negative control. Table 3 show the percentage of inhibition of B. carinata and sinigrin (respectively) when are assayed against H2O2. As expected, the addition of plant/compound samples to the fly food produced antimutagenic effects.Both samples showed a high desmutagenic and recombinogenic potency always producing the total mutation rates below the negative control values (Table 3). An inverse dose effect was also observed for B. carinata and sinigrin samples so, the lowest concentrations assayed for plant samples were more antigenotoxic than those of higher (78.46% clone inhibition) but, for sinigrin samples this was reversed: the highest antigenotoxic effect corresponded to a sinigrin concentration of 4.81 mM with a percentage of inhibition of clone formation of 84.61% (Figure 2). This healthier beneficial effect of sinigrin at higher concentrations is in agreement with the survival and genotoxicity experiments in which its positive effect was superior to those of B. carinata. Unlike sinigrin, the effects of B. carinata samples are the result of a complex mixture with a large number of different compounds with different effects. Further studies will be required in order to elucidate the underlying B. carinata and sinigrin protective mechanism. Nevertheless, B. carinata antimutagenic properties have been demonstrated.Other Brassica spp. like B. oleracea L. var. acephala (kale) present the same effect. The leaf extract of these plants has neither genotoxic nor clastogenic activity in cells of mice but a strong antigenotoxic effect. This Brassica variety presents a similar GLS profile to B. carinata, both with sinigrin as major leaf GLS and best candidate responsible of this DNA protective effect.2.3. In Vitro AssaysThe promyelocytic cell line HL60 has been selected as a model on a big variety of substances candidates to be used as anticarcinogens and has proved to be a robust test system for pilot screening experiments. In the case of GLS breakdown products, different HL60 cell lines have been used to prove the anticarcinogenic properties of diverse ITC groups resulting AITC the most effective arresting cell cycle. Now, we have used this system to determine the antitumor properties of the plant B. carinata and specifically, its major GLS sinigrin by measuring the relative inhibitory capacity of tumor growing in HL60 cells. Our experiments have evidenced that B. carinata plant possesses antiproliferative properties and highlight the use of this plant in cancer chemoprevention.The results on Figure 3 represent the relative growing rate of HL60 cultures (expressed as cell survival) with different concentrations of B. carinata and sinigrin respect to their concurrent control cultures. B. carinata results showed a dose-response curve with a high tumoricide activity in HL60 cells (IC50 value of 0.28 mg mL-1). However, the antigenotoxic potency of sinigrin did not correlate with its null antiproliferative activity. The reason of this lack of cytotoxicity resides in the metabolic process by which GLSs produce their anticarcinogenic effect. In this sense, the fact that GLS sinigrin only acts as a cytotoxic agent when is hydrolysed by myrosinase enzyme revealing this mechanism.Under natural conditions, GLSs and myrosinases are stored in separate compartments in plant tissues and different process like feeding by insect, animals or, in human case, food processing can put them into contact. Then, plant tissue disruption induce bioactivation of GLSs, putting myrosinases and their GLS substrates into contact, and GLS hydrolysis results in the formation of their biologically active products. To achieve this, our experiments performed using D. melanogaster individuals did not require more sample process that adds directly the plant or the bioactive compound to food waiting for their oral ingestion because of the presence of myrosinase in plant treatments or because myrosinase activity occurs normally during digestion and in the colon by microbial activity (sinigrin treatments). Contrarily, cytotoxicity assays with HL60 cell lines required the addition of an external myrosinase to sinigrin solution as a necessary step in order to produce its hydrolysis and antiproliferative activity (Figure 3C) because the addition of single sinigrin to cell medium did not produce expected effect by reducing cell proliferation (Figure 3B). So that, sinigrin produced antiproliferative activity in HL60 culture only after its hydrolysis by the enzyme myrosinase (hydrolysed sinigrin IC50 = 2.71 microM). In this sense, the presence of constitutive myrosinase in B. carinata plant samples justifies the antiproliferative activity found in the present research (Figure 3A). This activity also shows that lyophilized plants do not affect myrosinase function and conserved it intact, unlike other processing methods although the combined treatment of plant and myrosinase has not been assayed. As a dependent temperature enzyme, myrosinase activity is favoured by low heat process up to 30  C (in vitro HL60 experiment temperature), facilitating the total GLS hydrolysis and the apparition of their healthy properties. Authors suggest that the human body temperature should be high enough for a proper GLSs digestion and nutrient intake. In addition, another plant proteins and active compounds will be protected to maintain intact plant health effects.Others authors have found the same chemopreventive effect of Brassica spp. in certain tumor types by ceasing culture growth due to GLSs hydrolyzed into ITCs. All these research has focused on the anti-carcinogenic activity of GLSs and ITCs as responsible compounds and that their intake and posterior digestion allow this process. In this sense, other authors founded that sinigrin is able to inhibit induced hepatocarcinogenesis in rats when it is orally given in a diet containing 1.2 mg sinigrin mg-1 food. This antiproliferative activity has also been shown in human in vitro models as HT29 colorectal tumor cells and SK-Hep1 human hepatoma cells. Our results are consistent with these researches because sinigrin is not cytotoxic but its hydrolysis products are. Further studies using each individual breakdown product of sinigrin can be conducted to elucidate the process whereby B. carinata induces the antitumor activity.In conclusion, our results not only support the health benefits for humans of B. carinata plant in daily intake as a recommended vegetable to include in human diet, but also present sinigrin as precursor of AITCs the bioactive chemicals responsible of this effect and break-down products of sinigrin hydrolysis by myrosinase enzyme."}, "30857170": {"doi": "10.3390/genes10030202", "title": "Molecular Cloning and Characterization of Three Glucosinolate Transporter (GTR) Genes from Chinese Kale", "abstract": "Chinese kale is a native vegetable in Southern China and the flowering stalk is the most commonly used edible part due to its high glucosinolate content and other nutritional qualities.

Their gene structure, physicochemical properties, signal peptides, transmembrane structures, functional domains, second and third-order protein structures, and phylogenetic relationships were predicted. The expression levels of BocGTR1a and BocGTR1c were much higher than those of BocGTR1b in various tissues, especially in leaves and buds.

BocGTR1a and BocGTR1c were strongly induced by wounding and heat stress. The expression of BocGTR1a and BocGTR1c was significantly silenced in plants transformed by RNAi technology. Total glucosinolate content was significantly decreased in mature leaves and increased in roots of RNAi-transformed plants compared to wild-type plants. In addition, we found that BocGTR1a and BocGTR1c may participate in glucosinolate accumulation in different tissues with a selection for specific glucosinolates. These results indicated that BocGTR1a and BocGTR1c may be the key genes involved in the glucosinolate accumulation in different tissues of Chinese kale.", "intro": "1. IntroductionGlucosinolates are a group of secondary metabolites containing nitrogen and sulfur, mainly found in the order Capparales. These metabolites play important roles in plant defence and in human nutrition. It has been clinically proven that some glucosinolate-derived isothiocyanate and nitrile compounds display anticarcinogenic activity. Depending on the amino acids from which they are synthesized, glucosinolates are divided into three major groups: Aliphatic, indolyl, and aromatic glucosinolates. Generally, the biosynthesis of glucosinolate occurs via three separate phases: The chain elongation of precursor amino acids, the formation of the core structure, and modifications of the side chain of glucosinolate. A number of key regulators and genes involved in the biosynthetic network of glucosinolate that are present in the genus Arabidopsis are known. Glucosinolates are synthesized in every part of plants except seeds and are then transported to storage positions in seeds and other parts. Glucosinolates were synthesized in other plant parts and eventually accumulate in seeds by GTR protein transport. However, the molecular mechanisms of the GTR-dependent transport system for regulating the accumulation level of different types of glucosinolate in Brassica vegetables are still unknown.Initially, researchers predicted that secondary metabolites often migrated in plants. Therefore, many researchers have tried to explore whether glucosinolates truly transfers and how this transfer occurs. Lykkesfeldt and Moller studied the biosynthesis of benzyl glucosinolate in various organs during the development of Trollius chinensis with radioisotope C14. The results showed that benzyl glucosinolate was mainly synthesized in leaves, but accumulated in seeds and other tissues. The amount of glucosinolates in seeds was measured in 39 ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana, showing a positive correlation between the content of aliphatic glucosinolates in leaves and seeds, which suggested that glucosinolates are transferred from leaves to seeds. The content of glucosinolates in plant seeds is higher than that in other tissues and organs, but the amount of glucosinolates synthesized in seeds is very small. Therefore, there is a transporting system for glucosinolates in plants.The transporter genes ATGTR1 (AT3G47960) and ATGTR2 (AT5G62680) were identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. GTR transporters play an important role in the transportation of glucosinolates in plants. There was no accumulation of glucosinolate in the seeds of GTR1 and GTR2 mutants, while the content of glucosinolate in wild-type seeds was very high. The content of glucosinolate in the leaves of double mutants was more than 10 times higher than that in wild-type leaves. Translocation and accumulation of glucosinolates in single-gene mutants of AtGTR1 or AtGTR2 were also affected, but the effect was significantly lower than that in double mutants, suggesting that if one of the GTR proteins were inhibited, the other would compensate for the loss of the GTR protein. GTR proteins participate in long-distance two-way transport of aliphatic glucosinolates between leaves and roots through phloem and xylem, but cannot transport indole glucosinolates, which indicates that GTR proteins may specifically transport a certain class of glucosides. Long-chain aliphatic glucosinolates are synthesized and accumulated in both roots and rosette leaves, but the root is the main storage site. Plants can regulate the composition and content of glucosinolates in roots and rosette leaves through a GTR-dependent glucosinolate transport system.To identify the role of GTR protein in regulating glucosinolate accumulation in Brassica crops, one out of seven and four out of twelve GTR orthologs were knocked out and they reduced glucosinolate levels in seeds by 60%-70% in B. rapa and B. juncea. This indicates that there are many GTR homologous proteins in Brassica rapa and Brassica juncea, which maintain glucosinolate transport function together, and there are key GTR proteins controlling glucosinolate transport to seeds for storage. Short-chain aliphatic glucosinolates are the main glucosinolates in Chinese kale, and the content of short-chain aliphatic glucosinolate in the root is higher than that in leaves and flowers, indicating that the root may be the storage site of short-chain aliphatic glucosinolate. Therefore, the molecular mechanism of the glucosinolate transport system in Chinese kale may be different from that in Arabidopsis.Chinese kale (Brassica oleracea var. chinensis Lei) is a native Chinese brassica vegetable that is widely distributed in Southern China and Southeast Asia. In addition to good flavor, the flower stalk and leaves are high in anticarcinogenic compounds and antioxidants, including vitamin C, total phenolics, carotenoids, and glucosinolates. Generally, the tender leaves and flowering stalks are the most common edible parts of Chinese kale. To regulate the accumulation level of glucosinolate in different parts, it is very important to understand the molecular mechanism of glucosinolate transport in Chinese kale. In addition, many previous studies reported that some stress treatment or environmental factors, including radiation, temperature, light, CO2 concentration, and salinity, could affect the accumulation of glucosinolates in plants. Therefore, it is very important to study the molecular mechanism of accumulation of glucosinolates under different stress conditions. In the present study, to identify the key genes involved in glucosinolate transport and re-accumulation in different tissues, three BocGTR1 genes were cloned from Chinese kale. The gene structure, physicochemical properties, signal peptides, functional domains, and phylogenetic relationships of three BocGTR1s were analyzed. The expression patterns of three genes were analyzed in various tissues and under different treatments and stresses. The function of BocGTR1a in Chinese kale was preliminarily analyzed by RNAi technology.", "results": "2. Results2.1. Molecular Cloning of Three BocGTR1sTo isolate the homologous GTR genes in Chinese kale, we searched the Brassica oleracea genomic database using the cDNA of AtGTR1(AT3G47960) as a probe sequence and three Brassica oleracea (B. oleracea var. capitata) GTR homology genes Bo3g113800.1, Bo1g076800.1, and Bo3g137030.1 were obtained. Chinese kale (Brassica oleracea var. chinensis Lei) belong to Brassica oleracea. Therefore, specific primers were designed based on the sequence of the three B. oleracea GTR1 homology genes above. The PCR amplification of the target fragment was performed using the DNA and cDNA of Chinese kale (Zhonghua) as templates, and three GTR1 were obtained, which were named BocGTR1a, BocGTR1b, and BocGTR1c, respectively (Figure 1A).Agarose gel electrophoresis showed that the PCR fragment of DNA was longer than cDNA (Figure 1A), which indicated that these three BocGTR1s have introns. NCBI BLAST was used for retrieval and alignment of the nucleotide sequence. The DNA sequences of BocGTR1a,b and c were 2798 bp, 2365 bp and 2605 bp, respectively, and the full-length cDNAs of BocGTR1a,b and c were 1905 bp, 1848 bp and 1848 bp, respectively. The structure of the BocGTR1s encoded protein was analyzed by GSDS2.0 software. These three genes have the same gene structure number (3 introns and 4 exons), but the length of introns differed among the genes (Figure 1B). The structure of the encoded protein of the three BocGTR1s have a similarity of >99% with the corresponding homologous gene, Bo3g113800.1, Bo1g076800.1, and Bo3g137030.1. BocGTR1a,b,c have similarities of 83%, 81%, and 85% with AtGTR1 (At3G47960), respectively. In addition, the similarity among the three BocGTR1s was 88.18%, as analyzed by Soft DNAMAN 7.0 (Figure 1C), which indicated that these three genes belonged to the same gene family as AtGTR1.2.2. Bioinformatics Analysis of Three BocGTR1sThe structure of the BocGTR1s deduced amino acid sequence was analyzed. The results showed that the molecular weights of BocGTR1a,b, and c were 70.44, 68.13, and 68.2 KDa, respectively. The isoelectric point value was 8.71, 8.94 and 8.86; the evaluation of total average hydrophilicity (GRAVY) was as follows: 0.238, 0.209, and 0.253, which indicated that the 3 BocGTR1s are hydrophobic proteins. The hydrophobic part was larger than the hydrophilic part according to the hydrophobicity of deduced protein analysis by ProtScale software (Figure 2A), which verified the prediction above. All three proteins contained a conserved domain of PTR2 (Pfam: PF00854) (Figure 1C), belonging to the proton-dependent oligopeptide transporter (PTR) family.The membrane-spanning regions of BocGTR1s and its homologous protein AtGTR1 were analyzed by TMpred software (Figure 2B). The location and number of trans-membrane proteins of the three BocGTR1s were similar to those in AtGTR1 in Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting that BocGTR1s and AtGTR1 were very similar in protein structure and may have similar functions related to glucosinolate transport. Signal P 4.1 was used to predict the signal peptide. BocGTR1a, BocGTR1b, and BocGTR1c had no obvious signal peptides and are non-secretory proteins (Figure 2C). BocGTR1b and BocGTR1c proteins contain coiled structures, while BocGTR1a proteins has no coiled structures (Figure 2D).The secondary structure of the BocGTR1a protein was composed of 42.43% alpha helices, 16.88% extended strands, 32.33% random coils, and 8.36% beta turns (Figure 2E). BocGTR1b and BocGTR1c had similar secondary structures with BocGTR1a. These results showed that changes in the amino acid sequence had no effect on the secondary structure of these proteins, but only on the ratio of different structures. The three-dimensional structures were constructed using SWISS MODEL software. BocGTR1a, BocGTR1b, and BocGTR1c have similar three-dimensional structures (Figure 2F), which indicated that these three proteins may have similar functions.2.3. Phylogenetic Analysis of Three BocGTR1 ProteinsThe three BocGTR1s have high similarities (>80%) with the NRT1/PTR-like proteins from cruciferous plants, such as B. oleracea, B. napus, and Raphanus sativus, and a similarity of 60%~80% with the NRT1/PTR (NPF) family members from Camelina sativa, Citrus sinensis, and Glycine max. Three BocGTR1s and 41 homologous proteins from 25 plants were analysed by phylogenetic tree analysis. BocGTR1c was first clustered with three predicted NPF proteins, XP_013629352.1, CDY36913.1, and XP_009149857.2, from B. oleracea, B. napus and B. rapa, respectively, and BocGTR1b were first clustered with another three predicted NPF proteins from B. oleracea, B. napus, and B. rapa, and both BoGTR1b and BoGTR1c belonged to clade I (Figure 3A). BocGTR1a was also first clustered with three predicted NPF proteins XP_013621918.1, XP_013742223.1, and XP_009150212.1 from B. oleracea, B. napus and B. rapa, respectively, in the fourth branch, and these proteins were very far away from clade I (Figure 3A). In addition, several predicted NRT1/PTR proteins from V. vinifera, S. indicum, T. hassleria, and others, were clustered in the second branch. Several predicted NPF proteins from R. communis, G. max, and C. sinensis were clustered in the third branch (Figure 3A). The protein domain was predicted by Pfam and SMART, and the results indicated that every homologous sequence contained the PTR2 domain, belonging to the NPF gene family (Figure 3B).2.4. Expression Profile of BocGTR1s in Different TissuesThe expression patterns of the three BocGTR1s in different tissues of Chinese kale were preliminarily analyzed by qRT-PCR using fully grown plants (Figure S1A). The expression levels of the three BocGTR1s in leaves and buds were higher than those in other tissues, such as leaf veins, petioles, young bolting stem flesh, middle-aged bolting stem flesh, bolting stem skin, and roots. Generally, the expression levels of BocGTR1a and BocGTR1c were higher than those of BocGTR1b in all examined tissues (Figure 4A). This finding indicated that the function of BocGTR1a and BocGTR1c may be more important than BocGTR1b in the role of glucosinolate transport or accumulation.To identify the role of BocGTR1s in seeds, gene expression patterns were analyzed in the silique coat and seeds of mature siliques (Figure S1B,C). In general, the expression levels of the three genes in silique coats and seeds were higher than the other examined tissues, such as mature leaves, middle-aged bolting stem skins and roots, indicating that, at this stage, the three BocGTR1s were more important in siliques than in other tissues. The expression levels of BocGTR1a were much higher in silique coats and seeds at stage 4 than at the early stage (Figure 4B). However, the expression levels of BocGTR1a were much higher in silique coats and seeds at the early stage than those at the late stage (Figure 4B). BocGTR1c had higher expression levels in silique coats at the early stage, with an expression peak in seeds at stage 3 (Figure 4B). These results indicated that BocGTR1a may play more important roles in siliques at the late stage than at the early stage, but BocGTR1b was more important in siliques at the early stage. In addition, the relative expression levels of BocGTR1a and BocGTR1c were higher than those of BocGTR1b in siliques at different stages and all other examined tissues (Figure 4B).2.5. Expression Profile of BocGTR1s under Different Stress TreatmentsThe expression patterns of BocGTR1s in response to injury, heat stress, treatment with methyl jasmonate, salicylic acid, MgCl2 and NaCl were analyzed. The expression of BocGTR1a was induced by wounding at 0.25 hours of treatment, peaking after 1 h of treatment and then declining in the roots, hypocotyl, and leaves (Figure 5A). Similarly, the expression levels of BocGTR1b and BocGTR1c were also induced by wounding stress in three examined tissues (Figure 5A). All three BocGTR1s were upregulated in roots and leaves after 3 hours of heat stress by incubation at 40  C (Figure 5B).After treatment with 100 microM salicylic acid, the expression levels of BocGTR1a and BocGTR1c increased first and then decreased in roots and hypocotyls, but not in leaves (Figure 5C). The expression of BocGTR1b was not clearly upregulated by salicylic acid treatment (Figure 5C).The expression of BocGTR1a and BocGTR1c was slightly induced by 100 microM methyl jasmonate treatment in roots and hypocotyls, but not in leaves (Figure 5D). The expression of BocGTR1b was not clearly upregulated by methyl jasmonate (Figure 5D).The expression of BocGTR1a was increased after 2 h of 10 mM MgCl2 treatment until 24 h in roots, hypocotyls, and leaves. After treatment with MgCl2, the expression of BocGTR1c in hypocotyls and leaves increased first and then decreased, but it did not change significantly in roots (Figure 5E). The expression levels of BocGTR1b were not induced by MgCl2 treatment in any of the examined tissues (Figure 5E). After treatment with 100 mM NaCl, the expression levels of BocGTR1a and BocGTR1c increased first and then decreased in roots and hypocotyls, but showed no regular expression pattern in leaves (Figure 5F). The expression patterns of BocGTR1b was slightly upregulated by NaCl treatment in three tissues (Figure 5F).2.6. BocGTR1a RNAi Transgenic Chinese Kale Plants Exhibited Altered Glucosinolate Levels in Roots and LeavesTo analyse the function of the BocGTR1a gene, the RNAi vector of BocGTR1a was used for transformation. Approximately 3500 Chinese kale explants were used to carry out the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, and 11 PPT-resistant lines were obtained following regeneration. When these lines were analyzed by PCR using the oligonucleotide primers specific for the bar gene sequence, only four of them showed the expected amplification product (Figure 6A, lanes 5, 6, 12, and 13). No amplification signal was observed for the untransformed control line (Figure 6A lane 17). The results preliminarily demonstrated that the BocGTR1a RNAi gene had been integrated into the genome of the transgenic lines. These transgenic plants (named T1, T2, T3, and T4) were propagated, rooted, and transferred into the greenhouse. The expression of BocGTR1s in transgenic plants was analysed by qRT-PCR using RNA extracted from leaves of four PCR-positive transgenic plants as a template. The expression levels of BocGTR1a were decreased significantly in the RNAi plants T1, T2, and T4 compared to wild-type plants (Figure 6A), suggesting that the expression of BocGTR1a was knocked down in RNAi-BocGTR1a plants. However, the expression of BocGTR1a in T3 plants was not reduced (Figure 6B), which indicated that BocGTR1a was not successfully knocked down in T3 plants. Therefore, the RNAi plants T1, T2, and T4 were chosen for further study. The expression patterns of BocGTR1b and BocGTR1c were analyzed in RNAi plants. Interestingly, the expression levels of BocGTR1c were also decreased significantly in the RNAi plants T1, T2, and T4 compared to wild-type plants (Figure 6B), as a result of the high similarity between the cDNA sequence of BocGTR1a and BocGTR1c. However, the expression levels of BocGTR1b were not significantly decreased in any RNAi plants, which may be because BocGTR1b was expressed in Chinese kale plants at a very low level.To analyse the function of BocGTR1a involved in glucosinolate transport or reaccumulation in Chinese kale, the contents of different glucosinolates were determined in the RNAi and wild-type plans. In this experiment, the glucosinolate content of the sixth leaf and roots from RNAi (T1, T2, and T4) and wild-type plants were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Two biological replicates were conducted, and similar results were obtained. Three technical replicates were performed for each biological replicate. When the BocGTR1a gene were knocked down in RNAi plants, the levels of total glucosinolates were significantly decreased in the leaves of RNAi plants compared with the wild-type plants (Figure 6C), and the content of gluconapin, glucobrassicin and progoitrin were also significantly decreased in the leaves of three RNAi plants (Figure 6D). In addition, total glucosinolates in roots were increased significantly in three RNAi plants (Figure 6E), and the contents of progoitrin, sinigrin, and neoglucobrassicin were also increased in RNAi plants compared with the WT plants (Figure 6F). However, some of the glucosinolate compounds, including sinigrin and Glucobrassicin, were not altered in all the three RNAi plants, which indicated that BocGTR1a may have different roles in the transport of different glucosinolate compounds."}, "31670121": {"doi": "10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.125660", "title": "Profiling Glucosinolate Metabolites in Human Urine and Plasma After Broccoli Consumption Using Non-targeted and Targeted Metabolomic Analyses", "abstract": "Broccoli is a popular brassica vegetable and its consumption may decrease the occurrence of cancer in certain populations. To gain insight into the metabolites that may induce physiological responses to broccoli intake, a non-targeted metabolomic approach and a targeted approach for analysis of glucosinolate metabolites were developed using high resolution accurate mass spectrometry. A human study was conducted in which 6 subjects consumed a single meal of 200 g of uncooked broccoli florets. The metabolomic analysis revealed changes in endogenous metabolites and a decrease in hippuric acid after broccoli consumption. Targeted analysis using high-resolution, accurate mass-mass spectrometry (HRAM-MS) enabled detection of low concentrations (nM) of glucosinolate metabolites in human urine and plasma. Glucosinolate metabolites were found in human urine (13) and plasma (8), respectively. Metabolites from methoxyl-indole glucosinolates, arising from broccoli consumption, are reported for the first time. Most glucosinolate metabolites reached their peak concentration in urine 2-4 h after consumption while, in plasma, peak maxima were achieved 2 h after intake. The results suggest that glucoraphanin metabolites (sulforaphane, sulforaphane cysteine, sulforaphane N-acetyl cysteine) and indole metabolites (ascorbigen and methoxyl ascorbigen from indole glucosinolates) may serve as marker compounds for the intake of broccoli.", "intro": "IntroductionEpidemiological studies suggest an inverse association between intakes of brassica vegetables and cancer occurrence. Among all brassica vegetables, broccoli is one of the most studied and its consumption is associated with decreased occurrence of prostate and lung cancer in some populations.Glucosinolates in broccoli are considered to be the most important secondary metabolites and are the parent form of isothiocyanates. Isothiocyanates are reported to be potent inducers of phase II detoxification enzymes and can induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Dietary glucosinolates are relatively inactive and are not absorbed by humans or mammals directly. Instead, they are converted to isothiocyanates in the presence of plant myrosinase or by the activity of enteric microflora. Isothiocyanates can be absorbed and further metabolized in humans, as parent and conjugated forms.Sulforaphane (1-isothiocyanato-4-methylsulfinyl butane) is the isothiocyanate derived from glucoraphanin (4-methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolates) and has been studied widely. Following absorption, it can be conjugated with glutathione and metabolized via the mercapturic acid pathway. The major metabolites of sulforaphane are N-acetylcysteine and cysteine conjugates. In addition to glucoraphanin, indole glucosinolates, such as glucobrassicin, 1-methoxyl-glucobrassicin (neoglucobrassicin), and 4-methoxyl-glucobrassicin are other major glucosinolates reported in broccoli. However, isothiocyanates produced through hydrolysis of indole glucosinolates are not stable and are further degraded into indole derivatives, depending on pH and the co-existence of epithiospecifier proteins. Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), a degradation product of glucobrassicin, has been reported as having chemo-preventative activity. The detection of I3C metabolites in human urine and plasma, after consumption of selenium-fortified broccoli, has been reported and the major metabolites were indole-3-carboxaldehyde, indole-3-carboxylic acid, and ascorbigen. However, other indole metabolites from methoxyl glucobrassicin have not been considered.For the quantification of isothiocyanates, such as sulforaphane, a cyclocondensation reaction of isothiocyanates with 1,2-benzenedithiol in combination with HPLC-UV detection at 365 nm, was proposed by Zhang et al.. This method can be employed for the quantification of isothiocyanates and their metabolites in brassicaceous extracts or biological samples. However, compared to the HPLC-MS/MS-based methodology, cyclo-condensation methods have low sensitivity and are not able to differentiate among individual isothiocyanates or their conjugates. Generally, quantification of indole derivatives from indole glucosinolates is performed using HPLC, with UV or fluorescence detection, coupled with mass spectrometry. Targeted analysis using multi-reaction monitoring (MRM) with mass spectrometry has also been developed for quantitation of indole metabolites.Metabolomic approaches may be used to gain insight into the metabolites that might induce physiological responses to diet as well as changes in metabolite concentrations in biological matrices, such as plasma, urine, and tissues. Numerous studies have used metabolomics to characterize different dietary intakes and metabolite changes. However, since analytical methods for non-targeted metabolomics are usually developed to detect as many metabolites as possible, signals associated with biologically meaningful metabolites, which present at low levels, may be lost in noise or much higher concentrations of endogenous metabolites. Hence, monitoring changes in low-concentration metabolites requires a combination of both non-targeted metabolomic and targeted analysis approaches.In this study, we employed these two approaches to pinpoint changes in glucosinolate metabolite concentrations in human urine and plasma after broccoli consumption. We developed an efficient procedure to discover metabolites in urine and plasma, using high-resolution, accurate mass-mass spectrometry (HRAM MS) detection with selected ion monitoring (SIM). The results expand evidence of changes in endogenous metabolites and glucosinolate metabolites in human urine and plasma following consumption of raw broccoli, changes that suggest or explained their proposed or demonstrated roles in human health.", "results": "Results and DiscussionQuantitative Analysis Individual and Total Glucosinolates in BroccoliAs shown in Fig.S1., a total of 10 glucosinolates were detected in broccoli and the total glucosinolate concentration was 14.67 mumol/g dry weight using the modified ISO-9167-1 method. Instead of using rapeseed oil as a control sample, High resolution accurate mass measurement was used to confirm desulfo-glucosinolates. The product ion at m/z 195.03 (C6H11O5S), representing the common thioglucose group, was used to confirm desulfo-forms of glucosinolates. In a previous broccoli-feeding studies , glucoraphanin (4-methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolate) metabolites, such as SFN and related conjugates, were investigated. However, indole glucosinolate-related metabolites are not widely covered, apart from perhaps glucobrassicin (Indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate, 3.15 mumol/g dry weight). The other major indole glucosinolates are neoglucobrassicin (1-methoxyindol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate, 4.98 mumol/g dry weight) and 4-methoxyl-glucobrassicin (0.44 mumol/g dry weight). These two methoxyl glucobrassicin comprised 37% of total glucosinolates, so it is necessary to study these metabolites from methoxyl glucobrassicin broccoli after consumption.Non-Targeted Metabolomics Analysis of Urine SamplesFor the non-targeted metabolomic study, samples were submitted randomly for analysis to minimize variance from instrument performance. Intensity variances for the major ion features (ion feature was defined as the combination of retention time and mass to charge ratio or neutral molecular weight of a metabolite) in QC samples are shown in Table S2. Variation in these ion features across the QC samples was less than 15%. The reproducibility of chromatographs was determined based on retention time variation, which were generated by Progenesis QI; retention times deviated by less than 0.2 min overall. Based on this, differences between test samples from different subjects are more likely to reflect varied metabolite profiles than analytical variation. The multivariate analysis of QC samples showed that deviation of the analytical system was acceptable and differences in metabolite profiles between the groups were due to designed experimental factors.Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed to visualize sample clustering, trends and outliers among the observations. After preprocessing using Progenesis QI, the data matrix contained 3761 metabolite ion features in positive mode. The abundance of each ion feature was normalized to the total ion abundance and scaled using pareto scaling method. Using this approach, there was no clear discrimination between samples collected at different time intervals. Further PCA was carried out on four analytical replicates and no clear separation was found, as shown in Fig. 1(A). These results suggest that variance came mostly from differences observed within each subject in response to the broccoli meal. Thus, the dataset was separated into 6 sub-datasets corresponding to each individual and re-examined.Using PCA, distinct clusters of samples formed reflecting individuals' responses at different times, as shown in Fig. 1(B) and Fig.S2. It was also found that individuals had different metabolic trajectories in response to broccoli consumption (i.e. between individual differences as well as within-individual responses), as clustering trends were different. The inter-individual differences in the urinary metabolite profiles were considerable and suggested that comparing metabolite changes within each subject would be more informative.A loading plot was used to select important ion features responsible for group separation. Nineteen ion features, marked as red squares in Fig. 1C, were determined to be important, based on an absolute loading value greater than 0.1 on either the first or second component. Among these, seven ion features were identified tentatively following searching of the open-source databases Metlin, HMDB and PubChem; tentative identifications are listed in Table 2. From the loading plot, it was worth noting that hippuric acid (5.95_179.0582n) had the highest loading and a similar changing trend among subjects after broccoli consumption. The control sample (hour 0) had the highest concentrations of hippuric acid, which decreased after broccoli consumption reaching the lowest point 2 to 4 hours after consumption, exception one subject (minimum occurred at 4-6 hours) and then increased up to 24 h (Fig.S3). Hippuric acid is thought to be related to consumption of fruits and vegetables in health children and adolescents in epidemiologic studies. The elevated level of hippuric acid were observed with the increase of fruits and vegetable juice consumption. In a following study by Penczynski and Krupp, the dietary flavonoids were believed to have the association with urinary hippuric acid excretion. However, these studies used 3-day weighed dietary records instead of controlled feeding, and no detailed information of fruits and vegetable were provided. In our study, we did not observe the increase of hippuric acid after broccoli meal. Besides hippuric acid, endogenous urinary metabolites, such as creatinine, uric acid and carnitines, were also detected.Changes in glucosinolate metabolites were not found using non-targeted metabolomic study, probably because variations were small compared to higher intensity endogenous metabolites and, thus, indistinguishable from noise.Targeted Analysis of Metabolites of Glucoraphanin and Indole GlucosinolatesThe non-targeted metabolomic approach, using a full scan MS method, lacked sensitivity. Thus, a more sensitive, specific, and precise method, based on selected ion monitoring with high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (HRSIM), was developed. Previous studies reported only metabolites from glucoraphanin and glucobrassicin metabolites, and did not include metabolites of 4-methoxyl glucobrassicin and 1-methoxyl glucobrassicin in their method. As methoxyl glucobrassicins are also significant components in broccoli (37% of the total glucosinolates), the metabolites from these two indole glucosinolates were also taken into consideration in this study.A time aligned HRSIM was optimized according to the retention behavior of metabolites on the C18 column. A +-0.005 Da window was used for reconstruction of selected ion monitoring chromatograms. The mass error for metabolites was less than 1 ppm.Under optimum experimental conditions, SFN, I3C, I3CAL, and I3CA exhibited good linearities, sensitivities, and reproducibilities in urine and plasma. The correlation coefficient (r2) were all > 0.99. Limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), and matrix effects are presented in Table S3. Due to the unavailability of commercial reference standards, sulforaphane mercapturic pathway metabolites were quantified as sulforaphane. Methoxyl indole carboxylic acid, methoxyl indole carbinol, and methoxyl indole carboxaldehyde were quantified using indole-3-carboxylic acid, indole-3-carbinol and indole-3-carboxaldehyde as reference standards, respectively. Ascorbigen and methoxyl-ascorbigen were quantified using indole-3-carbinol as reference standard. Methoxyl indole carboxylic acid, methoxyl indole carbinol, and methoxyl indole carboxaldhyde have several isomers and were quantified using the sum of isomer peak areas.Glucosinolate Metabolites in Urine SamplesFig. 2 shows typical SIM chromatograms for metabolites of glucoraphanin, glucobrassicin, and methoxyl-glucobrassicin. A total of 13 metabolites were detected. Sulforaphane (SFN), sulforaphane-cysteine (SFN-CYS), sulforaphane-N-acetyl-cysteine (SFN-NAC), and sulforaphane-glutathione (SFN-GSH) from glucoraphanin were detected in all but the fasted urine samples (t= 0). This is consistent with a previous report, except no sulforaphane-cysteine-glycine was found in our study. Concentrations of metabolites were normalized against creatinine concentrations. Average concentrations of SFN and SFN metabolites reached their peak at 2-4 h, except for SFN-GSH at 4-6 h. SFN had a mean maximum concentration of 1197.80 +- 942.43 nmol/mmol at 2-4 h, while SFN-GSH had a very low concentration of 5.15 +- 1.62 nmol/mmol at its maximum (4-6 h). Indole-3-carbinol (I3C), indole-3-carboxaldehyde (I3CAL), and indole-3-carboxylic acid (I3CA) from glucobrassicin were also detected in the urine samples. It is worth noting that for I3C, the protonated [M+H]+ form was not observed, while the [M+H-H2O]+ form was observed as the major peak. This is consistent with a previous report and might explain why I3C was not detected by Hauder et al. in a broccoli feeding study where the [M+H]+ ion was used for selected ion monitoring in their targeted analysis.Indole-3-acetonitrile (I3-ACN) and 3,3'-diindolylmethane were not detected in any urine samples. Notably, in the fasting urine samples, collected prior to broccoli intake, I3C, I3CAL, and I3CA were observed even though the subjects had been asked to avoid glucosinolates before the study. However, given I3-CAL has been identified as an endogenous metabolite in rat and human urine, this might not indicate lack of compliance so much as natural variation in a small group of individuals related to a metabolic pathway where I3C is converted to I3CAL and I3CA via oxidative reaction. Consequently, glucobrassicin metabolites, specifically I3-CA and I3-CAL, may not be suitable dietary marker compounds for cruciferous vegetables. However, concentrations of these metabolites increased significantly after broccoli consumption. Ascorbigen was also detected in blank urine samples from two subjects but at very low concentrations, whereas it was the most abundant metabolite at 2-4 h (9631.13 +- 6285.15 nmol/mmol).Based on the chemical structure of indole metabolites from glucobrassicin, it is reasonable to deduce that metabolites from methoxyl glucosinolates were methoxyl indole-3-carbinol (MI3C), methoxyl-indole-3-carboxaldehyde(MI3CAL), methoxyl-indole-3-carboxylic acid (MI3CA), and methoxyl-ascorbigen (MABG). Similar to glucobrassicin metabolites, these metabolites reached peak concentrations at 4-6 h, and MABG achieved the highest concentration 9824.68 +- 7145.73 nmol/mmol.Hydroxyl-ABGs are reported for the first time and these metabolites may be derived from hydroxy glucosinolates in broccoli or produced via oxidation of ABG. However, due to the absence of reference standards for these compounds, we were not able to differentiate metabolites arising from isomeric 1-methoxyl-glucobrassicin and 4-methoxyl-glucobrassicin, as they share the same elemental compositions. The concentrations of metabolites in urine are shown in Fig. 3 and possible metabolic pathways were proposed for indole glucosinolates are shown in Fig.S4.Glucosinolate Metabolites in Plasma samplesSFN, SFN-CYS, and SFN-NAC were the three major glucoraphanin metabolites detected in plasma samples. Concentrations reached maximum levels at 2-4 h, but were below the LOD at 24 h. The major glucobrassicin metabolites identified in plasma were I3-CAL, I3-CA, and ABG. I3CA was the predominant metabolite and reached its maximum at 2 h with a concentration of 70.30 +- 9.20 nmol/L. Methoxyl glucobrassicin metabolites detected in plasma were MI3CA and MABG, which had peak concentrations of 32.31 +- 27.98 and 29.49 +- 8.4 nmol/L, respectively. In comparison to metabolite concentrations in urine, plasma metabolites concentrations were much lower. Also, differences between subjects were significant for metabolites such as methoxyl-indole carboxylic acid and SFN-CYS. ABG or MABG were not detected at 0 h and reached their maxima at 3 h.Our results suggest that glucosinolate metabolites, SFN, SFN-CYS, and SFN-N-CYS, can serve reliably as markers for intake of brassica vegetables containing glucoraphanin or sulforaphane. They did not occur in control samples (t= 0) but were the predominant metabolites in plasma after broccoli consumption. Indole metabolites, such as I3CAL, I3CA, or MI3CA from glucobrassicin or methoxyl glucobrassicin, were detected in the control samples (t= 0), but their concentrations were elevated 3 to 5-times after broccoli consumption. Derivatives of ABG or MABG, including 4-hydroxyascorbigen, 4-methoxyl ascorbigen, and (the N-methoxyl derivative) neoascorbigen, have also been reported previously in brassica vegetables such as broccoli and kale. Therefore, ABG or MABG in plasma might originate not only from indole derivatives (degraded from indole glucosinolates via the mediation of myrosinase) that react with ascorbate, but also from direct absorption. The time-concentration curves of metabolites in plasma are shown in Fig. 4.ConclusionIn summary, metabolite profiles determined using non-targeted metabolomic studies can characterize responses to broccoli intake in humans. These profiles changed with time, after broccoli consumption, despite differential responses among subjects. The decrease observed in urinary hippuric acid might be associated with broccoli consumption. The very sensitive, high-resolution, accurate mass-mass spectrometry (HRAM-MS) needed for targeted analysis of glucosinolate metabolites was established and, for the first time, plasma metabolites from methoxyl glucosinolates are reported. The method detected multiple glucosinolate metabolites at the nM level in human urine and plasma after a single meal of uncooked broccoli."}, "12524361": {"doi": "10.1093/genetics/162.4.1937"}, "31023837": {"doi": "10.1105/tpc.19.00299"}, "33596258": {"doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0247032", "title": "Phytochemical characterization of turnip greens (Brassica rapa ssp. rapa): A systematic review", "abstract": "ObjectiveThe Turnip (Brassica rapa L. ssp. rapa) is a leaf and root vegetable grown and consumed worldwide. The consumption of Turnip has been associated with beneficial effects on human health due to their phytochemicals that may control a variety of physiological functions, including antioxidant activity, enzyme regulation, and apoptotic control and the cell cycle. The current systematic review of the literature aims to evaluate both the profile and quantity of phytochemicals commonly found in Turnip greens and to provide perspectives for further investigation.MethodsThis review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. Four bibliographic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web-of-Science and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials) were searched to identify published studies until April 8th, 2020 (date last searched) without data and language restriction. Studies were included if they used samples of Turnip greens (the leaves), and evaluated its phytochemical content. Two reviewers independently evaluated the titles and abstracts according to the selection criteria. For each potentially eligible study, two reviewers assessed the full-texts and independently extracted the data using a predesigned data extraction form.ResultsBased on the search strategy 5,077 potentially relevant citations were identified and full texts of 37 studies were evaluated, among which 18 studies were eligible to be included in the current review. The majority of included studies were focused on identification of glucosinolates and isothiocyanates (n = 14, 82%), four studies focused on organic acids, and five studies reported phenolic component profile in Turnip greens. Among included studies nine studies (50%) provided information on phytochemical's content. We found 129 phytochemicals (19 glucosinolates, 33 glucosinolate-breakdown products, 10 organic acids and 59 polyphenolic compounds) reported in Turnip greens. Flavonoids were mainly present as quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin derivatives; while aliphatic forms were the predominant glucosinolate (gluconapin was the most common across five studies, followed by glucobrassicanapin). In general, the phytochemical content varied among the leaves, tops and Turnip roots.ConclusionsEmerging evidence suggests the Turnip as a substantial source of diverse bioactive compounds. However, detailed investigation on the pure compounds derived from Turnip green, their bioavailability, transport and metabolism after consumption is further needed. Additional studies on their biological activity are crucial to develop dietary recommendations on the effective dosage and dietary recommendation of Turnip greens for nutrition and health.", "intro": "IntroductionBrassica, the most important genus of plants in Cruciferae (also called Brassicaceae) family, consists of about 350 genera and almost 3,500 species. The Brassica plants are very rich in several nutritional (carbohydrates, lipids, protein, vitamins, minerals) and phytochemical components (glucosinolates, isothiocyanates, flavonoids, phenolics) of medicinal value. Their roots, stems, leaves, flower buds, sprouts and seeds were historically used for food and as medicine. Health benefits of Brassica were often attributed to glucosinolates and phenolic compounds, that induce a variety of physiological functions including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity, regulate enzymes production and participate in apoptosis and the cell cycle control. B. oleracea (broccoli, cauliflower, kale, cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and kohlrabi) is the most famous species of genus Brassica and due to its worldwide cultivation and high consumption, its nutritional and remedial features have been extensively studied. However, the other members of Brassicaceae family (i.e., B. juncea, B. napus, B. nigra, B. carinata and B. rapa) that are far less studied, are as well important constituents of human diet and are valuable sources of vegetable oil.Brassica rapa ssp. rapa or Turnip is one of the most important leaf and root crops worldwide. It is cultivated for its delicious roots and leaves (greens) which are reaped during the vegetative period; while the Turnip tops, fructiferous stems with the flower buds and surrounding leaves, are consumed before opening and while still green. Young Turnip roots are commonly consumed raw in salads, yet, the Turnip greens and tops are usually served cooked or steamed. Turnip leaves are characterized by a bitter taste, which differentiates them from other Brassica vegetables such as broccoli, cabbage or cauliflower. Because of the trace amount of phenolic compounds and trivial antioxidant capacity, Turnip root is considered to be less beneficial to human health in comparison to Turnip tops and leaves. Although there were a few published articles about Brassicaceae family, so far only one review has summarized phytochemical compounds in Turnip roots, leaves and tops. However, that review was not a systematic review, did not report the quantity of phytochemicals identified in Turnip, and did not focus on Turnip greens (leaves), which is considered to be the most promising health promoting part of the plant. To help fill this literature gap, we performed the present systematic review focusing on Turnip greens, we searched the literature systematically and evaluated both the profile and quantity of phytochemicals commonly found in Turnip greens in order to provide a comprehensive overview of the current literature and provide insights for future research.", "results": "ResultsStudy selectionBased on the search strategy 5,077 potentially relevant citations were identified and after removing 1,230 duplicates, 3,847 abstracts and titles were evaluated according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full texts of 37 studies were evaluated, among which 18 studies were eligible to be included in the current review (Fig 1). The majority of included studies (n = 14; 82.4%) focused on glucosinolates and their breakdown products in Turnip greens, four studies reported on organic acids and additional five on phenolic compounds. Among included studies nine studies (50%) provided information on phytochemical's concentration in Turnip greens. In the 18 included studies for final analysis, there were 129 phytochemicals and metabolites reported in Turnip greens. Summary of the most important findings can be found in Fig 2.Glucosinolates and breakdown metabolitesGlucosinolates (GLS) are nitrogen- and sulfur-containing plant secondary metabolites that are abundant in the Brassicaceae family. Depending on their amino acid precursor, GLSs can be grouped into three chemical classes, aliphatic, aromatic and indole GLS. If cruciferous is consumed raw, GLSs are hydrolyzed in proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract by endogenous plant enzyme myrosinase to several bioactive breakdown metabolites (isothiocyanates, nitriles, thiocyanates, epithionitriles, and oxazolidine). When vegetables are thermally processed before consumption, plant myrosinase is inactivated and GLS either partially absorbed in stomach of passed to colon where they are hydrolyzed by the intestinal microbime. GLSs are reported to have disease prophylactic and therapeutic effects mediated via their anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, chemopreventive, cytotoxic and anti-cancer activities.In current review, nineteen different GLSs were reported across 14 studies. Total GLS content varied from 17.78 to 74 mumol/g dry weight and aliphatic glucosinolate were the predominant GLSs (14 aliphatic, 4 indol and 1 aromatic). In particular, gluconapin was the most common GLS in five studies, followed by glucobrassicanapin; while in study by Vieites-Outes et al. napin was the major compound in all samples followed by goitrin. Thirty-three GLS breakdown products were identified, among them 19 isothiocyanates, 10 nitriles, and 4 epithionitriles (Table 1, S2 Table in S1 File). Epithionitriles were the predominant breakdown products due to the high abundance of alkenyl GLSs.The evidence on variations in GLS content among the Turnip anatomical parts was inconsistent. Cartea et al, reported total GLS as 30.74 mumol/g and 19.50 mumol/g dry weight for Turnip greens and Turnip tops, respectively. One study reported similar content, while in two studies total GLSs were more abundant in Turnip tops. In addition, 3-Butenyl GLS was predominant in both Turnip top and greens, while, in tubers 2-hydroxy-3-butenyl GLS and 2-phenylethyl GLS was found in high amounts. Epithionitriles were the major hydrolysis products with 4,5-epithiopentanenitrile and 3-hydroxy-4,5-epithiopentanenitrile being the principal compounds. Consistent with the previous results, Bonnema et al reported substantial differences in GLS profiles between aboveground tissues and Turnip tuber, reflecting the differences in their physiological role. In particular, glucoerucin and glucoberteroin were found in considerably high amounts in tubers, but were barely detectable in leaves; the gluconeobrassicin in contrary, was more abundant in Turnip leaves.The nutritional content of Turnip, besides varying among the anatomical structures and varieties, was affected by cooking preparations. In a study done by Vieites-Outes et al, steaming resulted in an increase (+17%) of the amount of total GLS, and while boiling resulted in a decrease (-50%) in the amount of total GLS. Similarly, in study by Francisco et al., steaming was the method that better preserved GLS and phenolic compounds while conventional boiling and high-pressure cooking methods presented similar rate of losses of total GLS content (64%). Nevertheless, genotype, environment and the stage of development of the plant were important factors to affect the GLSs content. In particular, Francisco et al. found genotype largely influences the aliphatic glucosinolates in the plant, while the indolic glucosinolate content was affected by both the genotype and its interaction with the environment.The GLSs the breakdown products, isothiocyanates and indoles, highly reactive and potent inducers of Phase II enzymes, have been associated with diverse health-promoting effects. In current review, sulforaphane, a potent anti-cancer isothiocyanate, was identified in a single study and in small quantities in the fresh Turnip sample 21]. Its precursors, glucoraphanin, was detected in a few Turnip varieties, was present in considerably smaller amounts (ranging from 0.003-0.35 mumol/g dry weight); whoever, the role of this aliphatic GLS in human health shall merits to be explored further due to its potential to convert to sulforaphane. On the other hand, progoitrin (found in cauliflower, cabbage, mustard, turnip, raddish, bamboo shoot and cassava), is considered an anti-nutritional GLS (due to potential anti-thyroid effects). In current review, progoitrin, was present in most Turnip varieties in low concentration (0.32 to 1.5 mumol g1 dw). Although, the evidence on potential goitrogenic effects of this GLS comes from animals the consumption of vegetables containing progoitrin should be carefully monitored in people with thyroid diseases.Organic acidsOrganic acids are intermediates of major carbon metabolism in plant cells and are involved in various biochemical pathways (glycolysis, photorespiration, the glyoxylate cycle) and play an important role in controlling plant cell physiology. Organic acids have been also implicated to control biochemical and physiological processes in vivo and are known to have antioxidant activity.Four studies reported ten organic acid in turnip greens leaves aconitic, citric, ketoglutaric, malic, shikimic, fumaric, oxalic, ascorbic, succinic and glutamic acids (Table 2, S3 Table in S1 File). Arias-Carmona et al, determined the organic acids in 44 samples of Brassica rapa var. rapa L. greens and tops and all samples presented a profile composed of at least four organic acids: citric, malic, oxalic, and ascorbic acids. The oxalic acid content was the highest in the analyzed samples, and varied between 138.40 and 83.89 mg/100 g fresh weight for Turnip greens and turnip tops respectively. The malic acid was second most concentrated and its content in the product varied between 89.34 mg/100 g fresh weight in Turnip greens and 37.12 mg/100 g fresh weight in Turnip tops. Citric and ascorbic acids contents in Turnip greens were 56.75 and 37.13 mg/100 g fresh weight respectively, and in contrast, the content of acids was higher in Turnip tops in comparison to Turnip greens. In study by Fernandes et al, the vitamin C content in fresh Turnip greens and tops was 62 mg/100g fresh weight and 46 mg/100g fresh weight, respectively. Also, the concentration of vitamin C was dramatically reduced by the processing method; after steaming treatment, the loss was 64% with respect to untreated fresh material and after high pressure and conventional boiling, vitamin C was not found in the edible parts. In the study by Fernandes et al. citric, ketoglutaric, malic, aconitic, shikimic and fumaric acids were detected in all edible Turnip organs, however, their content varied with higher content being present in flower buds, leaves and stems in comparison to the roots. Malic acid was the major compound in those edible parts with roots exhibiting significantly higher amount (ca. 81%), followed by leaves and stems (ca. 65%) while flower buds showed a significantly lower content (ca. 44%), suggesting that malic acid content may be useful to differentiate Turnip edible parts. Liang et al. in two publications detected malic, succinic and glutamic acid without providing information on specific acid concentrations. Trans/cis-hydroxycinnamates of malic acids were also reported in turnip leaves extracts: sinapoylmalate, feruloylmalate and coumaroylmalate, and their levels were higher levels in methyl ester of jasmonic acid than in jasmonic acid itself. In addition, after treatment with methyl ester of jasmonic acid after indole 3-acetic acid (an important plant hormone controlling a variety of developmental processes) was also increased.Polyphenolic compoundsPhenolic compounds is a generic term, which refers to more than 8,000 secondary metabolites in plants, which are categorized into different classes depending on their structure and subcategorized within each class according to the number and position of hydroxyl group and the presence of other substituents. They are classified into flavonoids (flavonols, flavones, flavan-3-ols, anthocyanidins, flavanones, isoflavones and others) and non-flavonoids (phenolic acids, hydroxycinnamates, stilbenes and others); with flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acid derivates being the most diverse compounds. They play a role in protection against UV, pigmentation, stimulation of nitrogen-fixing nodules and are important biologically active constituents of the human diet. In particular, they have strong antioxidant and free radical-scavenging activities and may regulate the expression of various genes encoding important metabolic enzymes and thus are involved in important physiological processes. Phenolic compounds also interact with human microbiome in the lower gastrointestinal tract, where they can positively influence the composition and activity of the microbiota, which ultimately leads to overall better health in humans.We have identified five studies reporting polyphenolic components in Turnip greens. Overall, 59 polyphenolic compounds (phenols, flavonoids, flavonol glycosides) were identified and listed in Table 2 and S3 Table in S1 File.Francisco et al. reported more than 30 phenolic compounds in Turnip greens and tops. The main naturally occurring flavonoids identified were kaempferol, quercetin, and isorhamnetin glycosylated and acylated with different hydroxycinnamic acids. Total flavonoids content of Turnip greens and tops were similar, 29.7 mumol/g dry weight and 28.44 mumol/g dry weight, respectively. The isorhamnetin was one of the major flavonoids in Turnip greens that is not present in the B. oleracea family, and serve as a biochemical marker of Turnip varieties. Turnip green was also shown to contain 22.8 mumol/g dry weight of hydroxycinnamic compounds compared to 10.2 mumol/g dry weight in Turnip top. Sinapic acid was the major hydroxycinnamic acid and the main phenolic compound in turnip greens. Its concentration in Turnip greens was considerably higher than in Turnip tops, 12.46 mol/g dry weight and 2.14 mol/g dry weight, respectively. Overall, total phenolic content revealed a higher amount in Turnip greens (31.51 mumol/g dry weight), than in Turnip tops (14.80 mumol/g dry weight). The authors hypothesized this disparity from the high amount of sinapic acid in Turnip greens, which is present in lower quantities in Turnip tops. Furthermore, after cooking, total phenolics content in Turnip greens was reduced in 15%, 75% and 72% in steaming, high-pressure cooking, and conventional boiling, respectively.Fernandes at al. showed that among identified phenolic compounds, kaempferol 3-O-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, kaempferol 3-O-(feruloyl/caffeoyl)-sophoroside-7-O-glucoside, isorhamnetin 3,7-O-diglucoside and isorhamnetin 3-O-glucoside as the main phenolics, were present in highest amounts. The group reported high organic acid content ranging from 36 to 51 g/kg dry weight. Aconitic, citric, ketoglutaric, malic, shikimic and fumaric acids were detected in all edible parts, but there were some qualitative differences, and a higher content of these compounds in flower buds,leaves and stems than in the roots were observed.Lin et al, compared the similarity of the phenolic components of 17 leafy vegetables from Brassica species other than Brassica oleracea. Among those, twelve plants were divided into three groups that had similar chromatographic patterns; while the remaining five vegetables namely gai choy, baby napa, rapini, baby Shanghai bok choy, and napa had individual phenolic compounds patterns. Turnip greens were grouped together with yu choy, and yu choy tip in group and peak 5-caffeoylquinic acid distinguished this group from the other two groups (group I: baby gai choy, baby mustard greens, and mustard greens with peak 4-p-coumaroylquinic acid and group III: baby bok choy, bok choy, bok choy sum, bok choy tip, Shanghai bok choy, and Taiwan bok choy with peak caffeic, ferulic and sinapic acid glucosides).Literature gaps and directions for future researchHigher intake of cruciferous vegetables was associated with multiple health benefits and lower all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Those health benefits were attributed to their high GLS content, phenolic derivatives and especially flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acids content. Previous human and clinical studies, however, explored the health benefits of cruciferous vegetables as a group, while studies focusing specifically on Turnip or Turnip greens in humans remain scarce. Conversely, emerging in vitro and in vivo studies are supporting the role of Turnip in improving health via its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.Based on current data, it is difficult to speculate which anatomical part of Turnip may have the most promising antioxidant capacity. The flower buds of Turnip exhibited the strongest antioxidant capacity compared with other edible parts in the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazine (DPPH) radical scavenging assay. Flower buds were shown with an IC25 value (extract concentration providing 25% scavenging activity) of 0.47 mg/mL, followed by leaves and stems (IC25 = 0.56 mg/mL), while the roots showed the lowest antioxidant capacity with an IC25 value of 1.44 mg/mL. In contrary, another study reported best antioxidant potency of aqueous Turnip roots whose DPPH radical scavenging activity was equivalent to vitamin C; followed by Turnip greens extract. Those contradicting may be because the antioxidant activity of Turnip was mostly assessed using the crude extracts of Turnip instead of isolated compounds. For example, flavonoids, one of the most abundant phytochemicals in Turnip greens, have been detected in Turnip greens and tops but not in roots, while GLSs are suggested to be more abundant in Turnip roots in comparison to turnip tops and greens.In addition, Turnip genotype, environmental factors, cooking preparations and the other dietary habits and intestinal microbiome have been suggested to affect the bioavailability of GLSs, flavonoids and isothiocyanates and may subsequently influence the antioxidant capacity of Turnip in vivo. For example, GLSs are relatively stable in plant cells, but cell damage by cutting, chopping or chewing food relieves myrosinase (beta-thioglucosidase) which hydrolyzes GLSs and produces molecules of beta-d-glucose and an unstable aglycone called thiohydroximate-O-sulfonate, which spontaneous reorganization results in the release of sulfate ion and the formation of plants metabolites. Previous studies have suggested that the inactivation of myrosinase, the processing and storage conditions, and the association with other food constituents are essential factors that affect GLS absorption and their metabolism.It is, therefore, necessary to better understand the metabolism of the major health-promoting phytochemicals in Turnip but also their breakdown products and to define sensitive biomarkers of Turnip intake. When exploring health benefits of Turnip or any other cruciferous in humans, usual dietary patterns should be carefully taken into consideration rather than focusing solely on metabolism of individual molecules (e.g. food components may interact with absorption and metabolism). Furthermore, dose-response curves should be explored for potential therapeutic and adverse effects associated with the consumption of phenolics, GLSs and their breakdown products (e.g. with progoitrin)."}, "35886968": {"doi": "10.3390/ijms23147619", "title": "UVA-Radiation Exposure of Different Durations Promoted the Growth, Phytochemicals and Glucosinolate Biosynthesis of Chinese Kale", "abstract": "Ultraviolet-A (UVA) (315-400 nm) is an essential environmental signal that regulates plant development and affects phytochemicals biosynthesis, including glucosinolate biosynthesis. The effects of different UVA (380 +- 10 nm, 40 mumol/m2/s) exposure durations, including 0 h/d (UV0), 6 h/d (UV6) and 12 h/d (UV12), on the growth and phytochemicals of Chinese kale (Brassica alboglabra) under white 250 mumol/m2/s LEDs were investigated. UVA exposure of different durations influenced the growth and phytochemicals biosynthesis of Chinese kale. Prolonging UVA irradiation throughout the growth cycle positively affected the growth and the development of Chinese kale, with evident increases in the dry weights of shoots and roots, plant height, stem diameter, specific leaf weight and flower budding rate. The application of UVA increased the soluble sugar content, whereas higher flavonoid content and antioxidant capacity (FRAP) and lower nitrate content were only observed in Chinese kale exposed to UV6 treatment. Besides, the qPCR assay showed that supplemental UVA-radiation exposure up-regulated the gene expressions of UVR8, transcription factors genes and genes related to the glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway, thereby promoting the accumulation of glucosinolates. Therefore, supplemental UVA-radiation exposure for 12 h/d was more conducive to plant growth, while supplemental UVA-radiation exposure for 6 h/d was better for phytochemical biosynthesis in Chinese kale in an artificial-light plant factory.", "intro": "1. IntroductionChinese kale (Brassica alboglabra), one of the important cruciferous vegetables, is widespread in South China and Southeast Asia. People popularly consume its flower stalk and tender leaves due to its good flavor, vivid green color and abundance in antioxidant and anti-cancer compounds, including glucosinolates, vitamin C, flavonoids and polyphenols. Particularly, glucosinolates are critical secondary metabolites containing nitrogen and sulfur in cruciferous plants. In addition to endowing plants with special flavor, glucosinolates and their hydrolysis products perform important biological activities. They play a defensive role in plants and in the human body.Light is one of the important factors regulating plant growth and development. The spectral component of solar radiation effective for plant photosynthesis is photosynthetically active radiation (PAR; 400-700 nm). Although UVA does not belong to PAR and it accounts for only a small proportion of the radiation reaching the Earth's surface, it can substantially affect plant growth and development as well as plant metabolic responses, as it accounts for more than 90% of the UV radiation reaching the Earth. There have been many studies on the effects of UVA (wavelength and intensity) and of supplemental UVA exposures (treatment period and duration, etc.) on the biomass and nutritional quality of different vegetables. Exposed to UVA, plants can induce the biosynthesis of glucosinolates (GSLs). Previous research on pak choi (Brassica campestris L. ssp. chinensis var. communis), broccoli (Brassica oleracea var. italica) and Brussels sprouts (Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera), as well as analyses of different UVA wavelengths and dose treatments of Chinese kale (Brassica alboglabra), revealed that targeted UVA irradiation could enhance the accumulation of glucosinolates. However, the effects of UVA-radiation exposure of different durations on the growth and development of Chinese kale remain relatively unknown.In plants, the glucosinolate biosynthetic pathways includes side-chain elongation, core structure formation and side-chain modification. Regulatory transcription factors (TFs) also contribute to the production of diverse glucosinolate components. This pathway was thoroughly characterized in Arabidopsis thaliana with the genes encoding the following glucosinolate biosynthetic enzymes: branched-chain amino acid aminotransferase 4 (BCAT4), methylthioalkylmalate synthase enzymes (MAM1 and MAM3), isopropylmate isomerases (IIL1, IPM1 and IPM2), isopropylmalate dehydrogenases (IMDH1, IMDH2 and IMDH3), cytochrome P450 enzyme, glutathione S-transferases (GSTFs), gamma-Glutamyl peptidase 1 (GGP1), C-S lyase (SUR1), UDP-glycosyltransferase 74 (UGT74) family, sulfotransferases (SOTs), five flavin monooxygenases (FMOGS-OX), 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (AOPs), indole glucosinolate O-methyltras-ferases (IGMTs), etc. However, the molecular pathways underlying UVA-induced glucosinolate accumulation in Chinese kale have not been elucidated.Four types of photoreceptors have been found in plants, namely, phytochromes (PHYs; the receptors of red and far-red wavelengths), cryptochromes (CRYs; the receptors of UVA and blue wavelengths), phototropins (PHOTs; the receptors of UVA and blue wavelengths) and UV RESISTANCE LOCUS8 (UVR8; the receptor of UVB wavelengths). These photoreceptors have some relationships with the expressions of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes. In broccoli sprouts subjected to UVB irradiation, UVR8 interacted with downstream COP1 to activate downstream transcription factor HY5 and then regulated the expressions of key genes such as FMOGS-OX5 and CYP81F2, inducing higher accumulations of 4-methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolate and 4-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate. When subjected to low red:far-red light ratios (0.55) of irradiation in Arabidopsis thaliana, photoreceptor PHYB became physiologically inactivated, while the activity of HY5 was inhibited, and the expressions of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes (SUR2, CYP79B2, CYP79B3 and CYP83A1) decreased, resulting in reduced contents of indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate.In this study, the growth and phytochemicals biosynthesis in Chinese kale subjected to UVA treatments of different lengths in an artificial-light plant factory were evaluated to clarify the effects of UVA exposure duration on growth, glucosinolate metabolism and regulatory mechanisms in Chinese kale development.", "results": "2. Results2.1. Growth PropertiesThe growth properties of Chinese kale were significantly affected by different lengths of UVA radiation exposure. Chinese kale subjected to supplemental UVA treatments (UV6 and UV12) exhibited higher fresh and dry weights of shoots and roots and lower shoot moisture contents than plants exposed to UV0 (Figure 1). Specifically, compared with UV0, shoot fresh weights significantly increased by 9.94% and 15.86% (Figure 1A) and shoot dry weights by 23.92% and 31.92% (Figure 1B), respectively, when plants were subjected to UV6 and UV12 treatments. In addition, root dry weight was also significantly higher, by 1.12 times, in Chinese kale exposed to both UVA treatments (UV6 and UV12) in comparison with UV0 (Figure 1B). UV6 and UV12 did not affect the root moisture contents in Chinese kale but significantly decreased the shoot moisture contents, presenting reductions of 0.84% and 1.08%, respectively, when compared with UV0 (Figure 1C).2.2. MorphologySupplemental UVA exposure induced remarkable changes in morphological responses such as plant height, stem diameter, specific leaf weight (an index of leaf thickness) and flower budding rate. Concretely, compared with UV0, plant height was significantly higher, by 1.11 and 1.27 times, in plants exposed to UV6 and UV12 treatments, respectively (Figure 2A), and the stem diameter of plants treated with UV12 was 10.07% higher (Figure 2B). Significant increases were observed in the specific leaf weight of plants treated with UV6 and UV12, but there were no statistically significant differences between the plants subjected to the two UVA treatments (Figure 2E). Regarding the flower budding rate, there was an increasing trend with the increase in the duration of supplemental UVA exposure, and the maximum flower budding rate of 45-day-old Chinese kale was 66% (UV12) (Figure 2F). However, no significant differences were observed in the number of leaves or in the leaf area of plants treated with UV6 and UV12 (Figure 2C,D).2.3. Leaf Pigment ContentsBy prolonging UVA exposure, the contents of Chl a, Chl b and Chl (a + b) in Chinese kale leaf increased (Figure 3A-C), whereas Caro content decreased (Figure 3D). Compared with UV0, significant reductions were observed in Chl a/Chl b of plants treated with UV6 and UV12 (Figure 3E), whereas with the increase in the duration of supplemental UVA exposure, an increasing trend of Chl (a + b)/Caro contents and a significant difference were detected in plants subjected to UV12 treatment (Figure 3F).2.4. ChlF PropertiesObviously greater Fv/Fm and Y(II) were observed in plants treated with UV6 and UV12 than in those treated with UV0, whereas no significant differences were observed between UV6 and UV12 (Figure 4A,B). Interestingly, significant reductions in Y(NPQ) and qN were only found in plants subjected to UV6 treatment and were significantly lower, by 30.42% and 19.35%, than those in plants treated with UV0, respectively (Figure 4D,E). However, no significant differences were observed in Y(NO), NPQ, qP, qL and ETR in Chinese kale treated with UV6 and UV12 (Figure 4C,F-I).2.5. Shoot Phytochemical ContentsThe shoot phytochemical contents of Chinese kale were significantly affected by UVA radiation (Figure 5). Compared with UV0, UV6 and UV12 notably increased SS content by 36.08% and 35.05%, respectively, but there were no significant differences between UV6 and UV12 (Figure 5B). Interestingly, UV6 treatment observably reduced the nitrate content of Chinese kale by 23.27% compared with UV0 (Figure 5C). The highest TF content was observed with UV6 treatment, followed by Chinese kale subjected to UV12 treatment (Figure 5E). In addition, FRAP followed a trend similar to that of TF content, but there were no statistically significant differences in FRAP between UV0 and UV12 (Figure 5H). However, no significant differences were detected in the contents of SP, VC, TPC and DPPH among UV0, UV6 and UV12 treatments (Figure 5A,D,F,G).2.6. Mineral Element AccumulationThere were many enhancements of the accumulation of mineral elements in the UV6 and UV12 treatment groups (Figure 6). Concretely, N accumulation was distinctively boosted by UV12, followed by UV6, in comparison with UV0. Additionally, the accumulation of P, K, Ca, Mg, S and Fe was increased in plants treated with UV6 and UV12, without a noticeable difference between the two treatments (Figure 6).2.7. Glucosinolate ProfilesEight individual GSLs were identified in Chinese kale (Figure 7), including four aliphatic GSLs (PRO, GRA, SIN and GNA) and four indolic GSLs (4-HGBS, GBS, 4-MGBS and NGBS). The total aliphatic GSLs accounted for approximately 90% of the total GSLs (the eight GSLs). The obviously increased contents of aliphatic GSLs (45.84% and 50.19%) and indolic GSLs (25.73% and 37.57%) in plants treated with UV6 and UV12 accounted for the significant increase in total GSL content (44.02% and 49.04%) (Figure 8A). Concerning the individual GSLs, GNA was predominant in Chinese kale (Figure 8B). Most of the individual GSL contents were significantly enhanced by UV6 (60.58-217.64%) and UV12 (27.56-462.37%) or maintained at similar level in UV6 (SIN, GBS and 4-MGBS) and UV12 (SIN and NGBS) (Figure 8B,C). However, PRO contents in Chinese kale grown under UV6 and UV12 presented decreases of 16.24% and 26.75%, respectively (Figure 8B).2.8. Expressions of Genes of Transcription Factors and Key Enzymes Related to Glucosinolate Biosynthesis PathwayThe expressions of genes encoding key enzymes responsible for GSL biosynthesis and related transcription factors (TFs) were monitored (Figure 9). Nine TFs involved in the regulation of GSL biosynthesis changed differently with apparent effects of UVA-radiation exposure duration (Figure 9A). Most of the TFs (MYB28, MYB76, MYB34, MYC2, MYC3, Dof1.1, IQD1 and TFL2) were significantly up-regulated by UV6 and UV12, while MYB51 was down-regulated. Among all differentially expressed TFs genes, MYB28, MYB76 and MYC2 were more sensitive to more prolonged UVA-radiation exposure (highest expression in plants treated with UV12, followed by UV6), whereas MYB34 was less sensitive to more prolonged UVA-radiation exposure. However, transcription factor HY5, known as the repressor of MYB TFs of aliphatic GSLs and activator of MYB TFs of indolic GSLs, did not change with the UVA-radiation exposure duration.In the GSL biosynthesis pathway, many genes were significantly up-regulated by supplemental UVA exposure (Figure 9B-D). Six genes (BCAT4, MAM1, MAM3, IMDH1, BCAT3 and CYP79B2) necessary for amino acid chain elongation showed obviously higher expression levels in plants treated with UV6 and/or UV12 than those in UV0-treated plants (Figure 9B). In the GSL core structure formation process, eleven genes (CYP83A1, CYP83B1, GSTF10, GSTF11, GGP1, SUR1, UGT74B1, UGT74C1, SOT16, SOT17 and SOT18) were found to be significantly up-regulated by supplemental UVA exposure (Figure 9C). In the side-chain modification process, in which the individual GSLs were produced, four genes (FMOGS-OX5, CYP81F1, IGMT2 and IGMT5) presented obviously higher expression levels in plants treated with UV6 and/or UV12 (Figure 9C). Inversely, two genes (GSL-OH and IGMT1) were down-regulated by supplemental UVA exposure (Figure 9D). Among all the differentially expressed GSL biosynthesis genes, BCAT3, CYP79B2, CYP83B1, GGP1, SOT17, CYP81F1 and IGMT5 showed the highest expression in plants treated with UV6, followed by UV12 (Figure 9B-D).2.9. Gene Expressions of PhotoreceptorsThe expressions of genes encoding photoreceptors (UVR8, CRYs, PHOTs and PHYs) were analyzed (Figure 10). Most of the detectable photoreceptor genes (CRY1, CRY2, PHOT1, PHOT2, PHYA, PHYB, PHYC and PHYE) showed no significant changes in Chinese kale treated with supplemental UVA exposure, except for UVB receptor genes UVR8, which was up-regulated. Besides, UVR8 showed the highest expression in plants treated with UV6, followed by UV12 (Figure 10).2.10. PCA and HeatmapA PCA and a heatmap were used to visualize the effects of different UVA-radiation exposure durations on the growth and the phytochemical composition of Chinese kale (Figure 11). Overall, PC1 and PC2 explained 55.15% and 13.90%, respectively (Figure 11A). The treatments were divided into three clear groups in the PCA scatter plot, with the UV0, UV6 and UV12 treatments being distributed in distinct quadrants. Chinese kale plants in the right quadrants (subjected to UV6 and UV12 treatments) were characterized by higher agronomic performance and nutritional composition.The parameters could be grouped into three clusters across the heatmap (Figure 11B), corresponding to the durations of supplemental UVA exposure. The hierarchical clustering analysis showed that the UV6 and the UV12 clusters were the closest to each other in the measured parameter responses. Higher biomass and phytochemical contents were observed in these two clusters. The UV0 cluster was separated from the other two clusters due to its lower biomass and phytochemical contents."}, "24614913": {"doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0091428", "title": "Identification of Metabolic QTLs and Candidate Genes for Glucosinolate Synthesis in Brassica oleracea Leaves, Seeds and Flower Buds", "abstract": "Glucosinolates are major secondary metabolites found in the Brassicaceae family. These compounds play an essential role in plant defense against biotic and abiotic stresses, but more interestingly they have beneficial effects on human health. We performed a genetic analysis in order to identify the genome regions regulating glucosinolates biosynthesis in a DH mapping population of Brassica oleracea. In order to obtain a general overview of regulation in the whole plant, analyses were performed in the three major organs where glucosinolates are synthesized (leaves, seeds and flower buds). Eighty two significant QTLs were detected, which explained a broad range of variability in terms of individual and total glucosinolate (GSL) content. A meta-analysis rendered eighteen consensus QTLs. Thirteen of them regulated more than one glucosinolate and its content. In spite of the considerable variability of glucosinolate content and profiles across the organ, some of these consensus QTLs were identified in more than one tissue. Consensus QTLs control the GSL content by interacting epistatically in complex networks. Based on in silico analysis within the B. oleracea genome along with synteny with Arabidopsis, we propose seven major candidate loci that regulate GSL biosynthesis in the Brassicaceae family. Three of these loci control the content of aliphatic GSL and four of them control the content of indolic glucosinolates. GSL-ALK plays a central role in determining aliphatic GSL variation directly and by interacting epistatically with other loci, thus suggesting its regulatory effect.", "intro": "IntroductionThe Brassica genus includes six agricultural important species which are grown in many countries, and important oil, condiment and vegetable crops. Brassica vegetables like broccoli, cabbage, Chinese cabbage, turnip greens and leaf rape, among others, are consumed throughout the world. FAO Statistics (FAOStat 2011) show that the production of cauliflower, broccoli, kales and other crucifers was 8.2% of the total vegetable production of the world in 2011. The most consumed crop of this genus in Europe and the USA is Brassica oleracea. This species includes cabbages, kales, broccoli and cauliflower, among others.Glucosinolates (GSLs) are the major class of secondary metabolites found in the Brassicaceae falily, including the Brassica genus. The hydrolytic breakdown products of GSLs (especially isothiocyanates) have beneficial effects on human health, such as cytotoxic and apoptotic effects in damaged cells, thus preventing cancer in humans and reducing the risk for degenerative diseases. They also enhance plant protection to abiotic and biotic stresses. GSLs could exhibit certain adverse effects. For example, progoitrin can cause goiter in animals, which provoked the deliberate reduction of GSL levels in B. napus in the past. However, there is no evidence of any goitrogenic effect coming from Brassica consumption in humans. Currently, efforts are concentrated on increasing the level of health promoting GSLs in Brassica crops. For example Sarikamis et al.  selected broccoli for higher levels of 3-methylsulphinylpropyl (GIB) and 4-methylsulphinylbutyl (GRA), which are the precursors of the isothiocyanates called iberin and sulforaphane, respectively. The beneficial effects of both isothiocyanates on human health are well known, having an influence on carcinogenesis during the initiation and promotion phases of cancer development. Knowledge on the genetics underlying the synthesis and accumulation of GSLs in Brassica crops is an important tool for designing appropriate strategies in order to increase the content of those GSLs related to human health and plant protection.GSLs are divided into three different classes according to the amino acid precursor in biosynthesis: (1) aliphatic GSLs derived from alanine (Ala), leucine (Leu), isoleucine (Ileu), valine (Val), and methionine (Met); (2) aromatic GSLs derived from phenylalanine (Phe) and tyrosine (Tyr) and (3) indolic GSLs derived from tryptophan (Trp). In Arabidopsis thaliana and Brassica crops, most GSLs are synthesized from Met. GSL biosynthesis is a tripartite pathway involving three independent steps (Fig. 1A): (i) side chain elongation of some precursor amino acids such as Met and Phe, by adding one or several methylene groups. Chain elongation is carried out by methylthioalkylmalate synthase enzymes (MAM). (ii) Development of the core structure, which includes several steps: aldoxime formation catalyzed by the CYP79 family of cytochromes P450; aldoxime oxidation by the CYP83 family; thiohydroximic acid formation by conjugation to an S donor and after C-S bond cleavage; desulfoGLS formation by S-glucosyltransferase (S-GT); and GSL formation by sulfotransferase. (iii) Secondary modification of the amino acid side chain which includes oxidation, hydroxylation, methoxylation, desaturation, sulfation, and glycosylation.To date, major genes and transcription factors involved in the three steps of GSL biosynthesis have been identified and characterized in the model plant, A. thaliana. Based on A. thaliana homology, three loci were identified in B. oleracea and cloned: two loci responsible for the elongation of the side chain of aliphatic GSLs named BoGSL-ELONG and BoGSL-PRO (homologous to MAM-1 and MAM-2 genes, respectively of Arabidopsis) and one locus responsible for side the chain desaturation and production of an alkenyl GSL named BoGSL-ALK (homologous to AOP2 gene of Arabidopsis). Afterwards, these loci, plus genes BoCS-lyase, BoGS-OH and BoCYP79F1, were mapped. However, genes responsible for other steps of the metabolic pathway remain undiscovered. Identification of metabolic QTLs (QTLs) is essential for the understanding of the quantitative genetic control of secondary metabolites and it is an early step to identify the genes underlying trait variation. The high co-linearity between A. thaliana and Brassica species can be used in order to identify candidate genes underlying QTLs that affect GSL content. In addition to identifying structural and accumulation QTLs, it is important to determine the extent of epistatic interactions between loci which may play an important role in determining variability for GSL content.The accumulation and profile of GSLs in plants are highly dependent on the genotype, although it is also affected by environmental and developmental factors. In Arabidopsis, GSL profiles have been systematically monitored during plant development and vary significantly among tissues and organs. In B. oleracea, developmental stages and the type of tissues may modify the type of GSLs and its levels. Currently, little is known about the genetics of GSL content within the plant ontogeny. For this reason, it is necessary to develop a better understanding of the genetics underlying GSL biosynthesis and accumulation in different tissues in B. oleracea.In the present study we identify QTLs for GSL composition and accumulation in B. oleracea leaves, flower buds and seeds in a double haploid (DH) population. We also perform a comparative genomic analysis based on A. thaliana-B. oleracea synteny in order to find candidate genes underlying QTL variation. Epistatic relationships among QTLs are also described. This information may increase the understanding on the quantitative genetic control of these traits and it is useful in order to identify genes controlling GSLs in B. oleracea.", "results": "ResultsPhenotypic variation in GSL contentTwelve GSLs, belonging to three chemical classes, were detected in the BolTBDH population (Table 1). Eight GSL were aliphatic, three of them belonging to the 3C group: 3-methylthiopropyl (GIV), 3-methylsulfinylpropyl (GIB) and 2-propenyl (SIN); four belonging to the 4C group: 4-methylthiobutyl (GER), 4-methylsulfinylbutyl (GRA), 3-butenyl (GNA) and 2-hydroxy-3-butenyl (PRO); and one belonging to the 5C group: 5-methylsulfinylpentyl (ALY). Three indolic GSLs: 4-hydroxy-3-indolylmethyl (OHGBS), 3-indolylmethyl (GBS); and 1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl (NeoGBS), and one aromatic GSL, 2-phenylethyl (GNT), were also detected.Different GSL profiles were detected in the parental lines. The following aliphatic GSLs were found in P1 (TO1000DH3) in different organs: GIV, GIB, SIN GER, GRA, GNA, and PRO. Aliphatic GER and GRA and PRO were detected in P2 ('Early Big' broccoli) meantime aliphatic ALY was found in the mapping population but it was not detected in its parents. Therefore, 3C and 4C GSLs were found in P1, while only 4C GSLs were found in P2. Alkenyl GSLs (SIN, GNA and PRO) were found in P1 but not in P2 (only trace amounts of PRO in flower buds) (Table 1).The GSL profile of the mapping population varied depending on the organ. In leaves, 55.2% of GSLs were indolic and 40.2% of GSLs were aliphatic, being NeoGBS and GRA the major GSLs respectively. In seeds, 93.3% of total GSLs were aliphatic, and GRA, GNA and PRO were the major GSLs. The GSL profile of flower buds was intermediate among leaves and seeds as 67.7% of total GSLs were aliphatic and 28.6% were indolic. GRA, GNA and NeoGBS were the major GSLs in this organ. GIV and ALY were exclusively found in seeds, meanwhile GER was only found in flower buds and seeds (Table 1).Aliphatic GSL content in P1 was higher than that found in P2 in the three organs analyzed (Table 1). SIN and GNA were the major aliphatic GSLs found in the three organs for P1. In contrast GRA was the major GSL in P2 in the three organs. Regarding indolic GSLs, GBS and NeoGBS were found as the most abundant in both parents in both leaves and flower buds, while OHGBS was the major GSL found in seeds. Indolic GSL content was higher in P2 compared to P1 in both leaves and flower buds.Total GSL content in P1 was higher than that found in P2 leaves and seeds (Table 1).In the mapping population, the content of individual GSLs as well as the content of aliphatic, indolic and total GSLs showed continuous distributions. Extreme phenotypes were found for all traits, with the exception of GNT in leaves, compared to phenotypes observed in parent lines (Table 1). For example, extreme mean values of some individual GSL content in the mapping population are far beyond the content of any of the parents. For instance, GRA content in seeds was 0.72 micromol g-1dw in P1 and 21.69 micromol g-1dw in P2. The average GRA content in the mapping population was 22.62 micromol g-1dw and ranged from 0.48 to 74.14 micromol g-1dw (Table 1). Total GSL content in the different organs varied nearly 18-fold within the mapping population. The average content of total GSLs was 4.01 micromol g-1dw in leaves, 10.13 micromol g-1dw in flower buds and 83.3 micromol g-1dw in seeds (Table 1).Analysis of varianceSignificant organ x line interactions were found for all traits, therefore individual analyses were carried out by organ. The source of variation due to lines was highly significant for the most traits, except ALY and OHGBS in leaves and GIV and NeoGBS in seeds. The source of variation due to replications was in most cases non significant (data not shown).QTL analysisThree out of eight primer pairs designed by Gao et al. were polymorphic in of the mapping population's parents. These markers could be mapped and located in three different linkage groups. BoGSL-OH mapped on C4 (28.8 cM), BoCYP79F1 mapped on C5 (102 cM) and BoGSL-PROb mapped on C8 (66 cM). SSRs OL12-D05 and Gi12 were also polymorphic and they mapped on C8 (49 cM) and C9 (40 cM), respectively. QTL analyses were carried out with 279 markers designed by Iniguez -Luy and the five newly mapped primer pairs. No significant QTL was detected in any of the map positions where BoGSL-OH, BoCYP79F1 and BoGSL-PROb were located (Fig. 2).Eighty-two significant QTLs were detected being spread all over the 9 linkage groups of B. oleracea. The number of QTLs by linkage group ranged between two in C1 and 19 in C9 (Fig. 2). Twenty significant QTLs were found in leaves. The value of R2 ranged between 10.3% for GNA in C7 and 34.3% for the sum of aliphatic GSLs in C7 (Table S1). Half of QTLs had a frequency of cross-validation higher than 50%. Twenty-nine significant QTLs were detected in flower buds. R2 value ranged between 10.4% for the sum of aliphatic GSLs in C3 and 49.7% for the sum of aliphatic GSLs in C9, respectively. Eighteen QTLs had a frequency of cross-validation higher than 50%. Thirty-three significant QTLs were found in seeds. R2 value varied between 10.3% for the sum of indolic GSLs in C6 and 49.4% for ALY in C5. Twenty-eight QTLs had a frequency of cross-validation higher than 50%.Consensus QTLsBased on the position of the QTLs and taking into account their confidence interval, a meta-analysis in order to render consensus QTLs for GSL concentration was carried out. Eighteen consensus QTLs were detected (Table 2). Fourteen consensus QTLs were present in seeds, 12 QTLs in leaves and 14 QTLs in flower buds. Seven QTLs were common to flower buds, leaves and seeds; three QTLs were exclusively found in leaves, two QTLs were exclusively found in flower buds and other two QTLs were exclusive found in seeds. In order to make the discussion clearer, results regarding consensus QTLs are going to be presented according to each chemical GSL class.Aliphatic GSLsLocated in C3, consensus QTL-3.1 controls the content of PRO and GNA in the three organs (Table 2). Alleles for increasing PRO content are given by P1, while alleles for increasing GNA content are given by P2 (Fig. 2). Consensus QTL-5.1, located in C5, controls the content of GIB and SIN in the three organs. Alleles for increasing the content of both GSLs are given by P1. In C9, consensus QTL-9.2, which controls the content of PRO, GNA, GRA, GER (4C-GSL) and SIN, and GIB (3C-GSL) in the three organs, was located. Alleles for synthesis of PRO, SIN and GNA are given by P1, while alleles for increasing the content of GRA, GER and GIB are given by P2 (Fig. 2). Other QTLs which control aliphatic GSL content exclusively are QTL-1.1, QTL-2.2, QTL-3.1, QTL-3.2, QTL-3.4, QTL-4.2 and QTL-7.2.Indolic and aromatic GSLsSeveral consensus QTLs only controlled the indolic GSL content. QTL-1.2, QTL-3.3, QTL-4.1 and QTL7.4 determined the GBS content in seeds and flower buds (Table 2). Alleles for increasing the content of GBS are given by P2 in all these QTLs except for QTL-3.3, where alleles came from both parents. Consensus QTL-2.1 determines the content of OHGBS and GBS in seeds and flower buds. The allele for increasing OHGBS is given by P2 in flower buds, while the allele for increasing GBS content is given by P1. Consensus QTL-8.1 determines the OHGBS, NeoGBS and total indolic GSL content in the three organs. Besides, this QTL also controls the content of the aromatic GNT. Other QTLs for GNT content are QTL5.2 and QTL7.1. The genomic regions QTL-1.2, QTL-2.2 and QTL-7.4 are collinear with genomic regions of A. thaliana in chromosomes 4, 5 and 2. In these regions, genes CYP83B1, CYP81F2 and CYP79B3 from A. thaliana were found by means of in silico mapping.Epistatic networksA total of 85 significant epistatic interactions were found when taking into account the three organs and all the traits. Thirteen epistatic interactions were found in leaves, 52 in flower buds and 13 in seeds. Some of these interactions are common to the three organs under study. Sixty-eight interactions were detected in aliphatic GSLs, 13 in indolic GSLs and 4 in total GSLs. An average of 3.5 significant epistatic interactions was found per trait (Fig. S1).Forty-two interactions were detected between QTLs, being two of them negative. Twenty interactions were detected between QTL9.2 (proposed as GSL-ALK in this work) and other QTLs in traits related to aliphatic GSLs (Fig. 3). The relationship between QTL9.2 and QTL 3.1 (proposed as GSL-OH) was found for the aliphatic GNA, PRO, GER and GIB in the three organs under study. The relationship between QTL9.2 and QTL5.1 (proposed as GSL-PRO) was found for the aliphatic GER, SIN and GNA in the three organs (Fig. 3). In the network controlled by GSL-ALK, interactions between aliphatic and indolic QTLs were observed. For example, QTLs 3.3, 4.1 and 9.1 control the GBS content and the three of them interact with QTL 9.2 in order to produce aliphatic GSLs (Fig. 3)."}, "30551645": {"doi": "10.3390/ijms19124037", "title": "Glucosinolate Profiling and Expression Analysis of Glucosinolate Biosynthesis Genes Differentiate White Mold Resistant and Susceptible Cabbage Lines", "abstract": "Sclerotinia stem rot (white mold), caused by the fungus Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, is a serious disease of Brassica crops worldwide. Despite considerable progress in investigating plant defense mechanisms against this pathogen, which have revealed the involvement of glucosinolates, the host-pathogen interaction between cabbage (Brassica oleracea) and S. sclerotiorum has not been fully explored. Here, we investigated glucosinolate profiles and the expression of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes in white-mold-resistant (R) and -susceptible (S) lines of cabbage after infection with S. sclerotiorum. The simultaneous rise in the levels of the aliphatic glucosinate glucoiberverin (GIV) and the indolic glucosinate glucobrassicin (GBS) was linked to white mold resistance in cabbage. Principal component analysis showed close association between fungal treatment and cabbage GIV and GBS contents. The correlation analysis showed significant positive associations between GIV content and expression of the glucosinolate biosynthesis genes ST5b-Bol026202 and ST5c-Bol030757, and between GBS content and the expression of the glucosinolate biosynthesis genes ST5a-Bol026200 and ST5a-Bol039395. Our results revealed that S. sclerotiorum infection of cabbage induces the expression of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes, altering the content of individual glucosinolates. This relationship between the expression of glucosinolate biosynthesis genes and accumulation of the corresponding glucosinolates and resistance to white mold extends the molecular understanding of glucosinolate-negotiated defense against S. sclerotiorum in cabbage.", "intro": "1. IntroductionWhite mold caused by the fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum infects more than 400 plant species, including important crops such as sunflower, chickpea and rapeseed. The pathogen usually infects plants as mycelia or airborne ascospores. Although a few fungicides are available to manage this disease, their low efficiencies, the environmental contamination they cause, and the economic costs of both the treatments and the disease itself are substantial. Thus, breeding resistant varieties is the best strategy to control this disease. Although the wide genetic diversity of the members of the Brassicaceae family makes it difficult to draw concrete conclusions, it is generally believed that resistance against S. sclerotiorum exists primarily in Brassica napus and its relatives. Some efforts have been made to identify resistance resources from wild crucifers, such as Erucastrum cardaminoides and Erucastrum abyssinicum, Erucastrum gallicum, and Capsella bursa-pastoris. More recently, scientists have identified resources with high levels of resistance against S. sclerotiorum from wild Brassica oleracea, one of the parental species of rapeseed. This finding brings new hope for improving S. sclerotiorum resistance of rapeseed, especially since its wild relatives, such as Brassica rupestris, Brassica incana, Brassica insularis, and Brassica villosa, show high levels of resistance. Completely or highly resistant lines of B. oleracea are not currently available. The lack of a resistance source has greatly constrained the breeding of B. oleracea for S. sclerotiorum resistance, so that little practical benefit has accrued to date from research on S. sclerotiorum resistance in B. oleracea. Moreover, the interactions between B. oleracea and S. sclerotiorum leading to eventual pathogenesis have received little attention. Resistance genes and secondary metabolites involved in plant-pathogen interactions provide general resistance to pathogens and insects. In Brassicaceae, glucosinolates (GSLs), vital secondary metabolites biosynthesized from amino acids that are perhaps best known for their anti-oxidative and anti-carcinogenic roles in humans, play important functional roles in the plants' own resistance to pathogens and insects. GSL metabolism is thus a potentially fruitful source of pathogen-resistance genes.GSLs can be grouped into three different classes according to the amino acid(s) from which they are derived: aliphatic/alkenyl glucosinolates, derived from methionine; aromatic glucosinolates, derived from phenylalanine and tyrosine; and indole glucosinolates, derived from tryptophan. Among the three classes, aliphatic and indole GSLs are the two most important in Brassicaceae. GSLs and their hydrolyzed products show significant antimicrobial and insecticidal activities as well as anti-fungal properties in plants. GSLs are the precursors of sulfur- and nitrogen-containing secondary metabolites such as isothiocyanates and sulforaphane. The effects of GSL metabolism and sulfur and nitrogen nutrition have been studied because Brassica crops contain large amounts of sulfur-containing amino acids and GSLs. In a study on the antimicrobial effect of crude extracts from Arabidopsis thaliana, 4-methylsulfonyl butyl isothiocyanate was found to be the main active compound, with broad antimicrobial activity, which implied that this GSL-derived isothiocyanate might have a protective effect against plant pathogens. Several investigations revealed alterations of GSL profile upon fungal inoculation. Initial reports described only alteration of indole GSLs, but more recent studies have reported alteration of both aliphatic and indole GSLs in response to fungal pathogens. Anti-oxidative compounds produced from the degradation of GSLs bring about plants' defense response against pathogens and herbivores. Biotic and abiotic factors, such as pathogen infection, herbivore damage, mechanical injury, and mineral nutrition, can modulate the GSL profile. Moreover, a wide range of defense reactions can affect GSL content.However, an association between GSL levels and resistance to various fungal pathogens in brassicas has not yet been established. In fact, studies in various Brassica species have repeatedly failed to find a strong correlation between pathogen resistance and GSL content following fungal infection, so the overall scenario is perplexing. In Arabidopsis, the MAM1 mutant showed a decrease in GSL level that resulted in susceptibility to Fusarium oxysporum, pointing to a protective role of GSLs against fungal infection. GSL levels are also positively correlated with oilseed rape resistance to the pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, with a few exceptions. However, high GSL levels enhance Arabidopsis susceptibility to the fungus Alternaria brassicicola. A negative correlation between GSL content in Brassica napus and resistance to strains of A. brassicicola and Alternaria brassicae has also been observed. The inconsistency of the existing data may reflect variations in the behavior of individual fungi (e.g., necrotrophs versus biotrophs), their host specificity (e.g., Brassica specialist versus broad spectrum), the genetic purity of the host plants (e.g., isogenic versus heterozygous lines), and the amounts of GSLs and their degradation products produced by the host plant. In cabbage (B. oleracea), the relationship between GSL content and resistance to S. sclerotiorum has not yet been studied. Several recent reports have shown that resistance to obligate biotrophs, hemibiotrophs, and necrotrophs might be linked to the production of indole GSLs in Brassicaceae. Moreover, in B. oleracea in particular, the enhanced accumulation of certain aliphatic and indole GSL compounds is associated with concomitant increases in the expression of GSL biosynthesis genes in several inbred lines. These findings on the association of resistance with the GSL profile of Brassica species prompted us to examine these plant-pathogen interactions at the molecular and biochemical level. Here, we investigated the correlation between GSL profiles in resistant and susceptible cabbage lines, and the expression of GSL biosynthesis genes upon infection with S. sclerotiorum.", "results": "2. Results2.1. Resistance of Different Cabbage Lines to S. sclerotiorumWe inoculated cabbage leaves of 45 inbred lines of cabbage with S. sclerotiorum and observed noteworthy differences in response in terms of the appearance of disease symptoms. In particular, one line, SCNU-C-049 (denoted hereafter as the resistant or R line), exhibited complete resistance with no disease symptoms, while the other 44 lines were susceptible to S. sclerotiorum, as evidenced by changes visible at 5 days post inoculation (DPI) (Supplementary File S1). We confirmed the resistance of SCNU-C-049 and the susceptibility of one selected S line (SCNU-C-033) through three repeated experiments, in which infected leaf, stem and head of both the R line and the selected S line showed consistent disease reactions (Figure 1). 2.2. Overview of Individual GSL Profiles in Cabbage LinesAnother study conducted by our group had previously produced a sample illustrative spectrum by mass spectrometry analysis of samples from cabbage lines that were resistant and susceptible to a different pathogen, ringspot (Mycosphaerella brassicicola), and used it to identify individual glucosinolate compounds found in cabbage leaves. We performed high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis to detect eleven GSL compounds identified in that earlier work in our R (SCNU-C-049) and S (SCNU-C-033) cabbage lines: glucoiberin (GIB), progoitrin (PRO), glucoraphanin (GRA), sinigrin (SIN), glucoerucin (GER), gluconapin (GNA), glucoiberverin (GIV), hydroxyglucobrassicin (HGBS), glucobrassicin (GBS), methoxyglucobrassicin (MGBS), and neoglucobrassicin (NGBS) (see HPLC peaks and GSL contents in Supplementary File S2 and Supplementary File S3). In non-inoculated control plants, the amounts of both aliphatic and indole GSLs (i.e., PRO, GRA, MGBS, and GBS) differed significantly from those in the inoculated R and S plants (Figure 2). Inoculating cabbage plants with S. sclerotiorum significantly changed the GSL profiles in the leaves of both the R and S lines. In the R line, the level of GIV was significantly higher, by 1.46-fold, in inoculated plants at 3 DPI, compared to that in mock-treated plants (Figure 2). In contrast, the GIV level was not significantly altered after fungal infection in the S line (Figure 2, Table S1). Similarly, the level of GBS in the R line was 5.28-fold higher in the treated compared to the mock-treated plants at 3 DPI (Figure 2, Table S1), whereas the S line did not show significant changes in GBS level after infection. Thus, GIV and GBS showed an increasing trend after infection only in the R line. In the S line, the levels of GNA were significantly higher, by 2.34-fold, at 3 DPI in the treated compared to the mock-treated plants, whereas the GNA level was not significantly altered in the R line after infection (Figure 2, Table S1). Overall, our results showed that the contents of both aliphatic GIV and indole GBS increased in the R line, but not the S line, starting at the time of infection (Figure 2). In addition, the total GSL content did not vary significantly in either the R or the S line at 3 DPI (Figure S1).2.3. Upregulation of MYB28-Bol017019, MYB34-Bol017062, ST5a-Bol026200, ST5a-Bol039395, ST5b-Bol026202 and ST5c-Bol030757 in the R Line after InoculationIn order to investigate whether the expression levels of genes belonging to the aliphatic and indole GSL biosynthesis pathways, and their associated transcription factors, are associated with plant resistance upon S. sclerotionum infection, reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed. The Actin gene (actin1) was used for normalization of expression of 38 target genes. The expression levels and melting curves of the Actin gene and 38 glucosinolate-biosynthesis-related genes are given in Supplementary File S3 and Supplementary File S4, respectively. The forward and reverse primers of Actin1 were designed based on the sequence available at NCBI database (GenBankAccession no. AF044573). The selection of that gene as reference gene to perform expression data normalization was based on previous reports showing the stability of that gene in the same plant species upon similar experimental conditions. Here we report the changes in the transcription levels of genes encoding aliphatic and indole GSL biosynthesis and their associated transcription factors that resulted from S. sclerotiorum infection. We found that two genes encoding transcription factors:one affecting the synthesis of an aliphatic GSL, MYB28-Bol017019, and one that of an indole GSL, MYB34-Bol017062:showed 10.21-fold and 3.08-fold upregulation at 1 DPI in the R line after infection, respectively, as compared to their expression in mock-treated plants (Figure 3, Table 1, and Table S2). Two aliphatic biosynthesis genes, ST5b-Bol026202 and ST5c-Bol030757, and two indole biosynthesis genes, ST5a-Bol026200 and ST5a-Bol039395, were also significantly upregulated in the R line at 3 DPI: ST5b-Bol026202 and ST5c-Bol030757 exhibited 5.6-fold and 68.59-fold upregulation, whereas ST5a-Bol026200 and ST5a-Bol039395 exhibited 82.90-fold and 25.30-fold upregulation, respectively (Figure 3, Table 1, and Tables S3 and S4). 2.4. Upregulation of Transcription Factor-Related Genes and GSL Biosynthesis Genes in the S Line after InoculationWe measured the expression levels of 10 GSL biosynthesis genes in the control, mock-treated, and infected plants. In the uninfected control plants, one indole GSL biosynthesis gene, CYP81F1-Bol017376, showed significantly higher expression in the R line compared to the S line (Figure 4). In the S line at 1 DPI, MYB28-Bol036743, MYB29-Bol008849, MYB28-Bol036286, and MYB28-Bol007795, which encode transcription factors genes related to the aliphatic GSLs, showed increased expression (of 5.8-, 51.0-, 21.6-, and 2.9-fold, respectively) in the treated compared to the mock-treated plants (Figure 4, Table 1, Table S2). In addition, the aliphatic GSL biosynthesis genes FMOGS-OX2-Bol010993, AOP2-Bo3g052110, AOP2-Bo9g006240, and GSL-OH-Bol033373 had 5.5-, 8.4-, 11.4-, and 65.3-fold higher expression, respectively (Figure 4, Table 1, Table S3). Among the indole GSL biosynthesis genes, CYP81F1-Bol017375 had 2.0-fold higher expression at 1 DPI and CYP81F1-Bol017376 had 7.96-fold higher expression at 3 DPI in the S line in the treated compared to the mock-treated plants (Figure 4, Table 1 and Table S4).2.5. Upregulation of Transcription-Factor-Related Genes and GSL Biosynthesis Genes in Both R and S LinesAmong the 38 transcription-factor-related genes and GSL biosynthesis genes investigated, the expression of 10 genes was upregulated in both R and S lines after inoculation, compared to that in mock-treated plants (Table 1, Figure S2). MYMYB122-Bol026204, which encodes a transcription factor related to indole GSLs, had 189-fold increased expression in the R line at 3 DPI (Table 1, Figure S2, and Table S2). Increased expression was also found in infected plants of the R line at 3 DPI for the following indole GSL biosynthesis pathway genes: CYP81F4-Bol032712 by 21.1-fold, CYP81F2-Bol026044 by 54.5-fold, CYP81F2-Bol014239 by 871-fold, CYP81F2-Bol012237 by 48.3-fold, IGMT1-Bol007029 by 24.7-fold, and IGMT2-Bol007030 by 171-fold (Table 1, Figure S2, Table S4). In contrast, the S line showed much lower upregulation of these genes after infection at 3 DPI compared to that in the mock-treated plants: CYP81F4-Bol032712 expression was increased by 14.5-fold, CYP81F2-Bol026044 by 44.9-fold, CYP81F2-Bol014239 by 1135-fold (1.75-fold lower than in the R-line), CYP81F2-Bol012237 by 12.5-fold, IGMT1-Bol007029 by 10.3-fold, and IGMT2-Bol007030 by 41.1-fold (Table 1, Figure S2, Table S4). Meanwhile, we observed inconsistent responses in the expression of 12 genes (MYB34-Bol007760, MYB34-Bol036262, MYB51-Bol013207, MYB51-Bol030761, ST5b-Bol026201, CYP81F1-Bol028913, CYP81F3-Bol032711, CYP81F3-Bol028919, CYP81F4-Bol028918, FMOGS-OX5-Bol029100, FMOGS-OX5-Bol031350, and AOP2-Bo2g102190) in response to fungal treatments in the R and S lines (Figure S3).2.6. Correlation between the Levels of Individual GSLs and the Expression Level of GSL Biosynthesis Pathway Genes Induced by S. sclerotiorum in the R and S Lines Heat maps of the fold changes in the expression levels of transcription-factor-related genes and GSL biosynthesis genes that we observed after pathogen inoculation emphasized that these changes were consistent with the changes in the levels of individual GSLs measured in the R and S lines after infection, as compared to the mock-treated controls (Figure 5). We obtained the highest significant positive correlation values for Pearson's correlation coefficient between the levels of the aliphatic GSLs GIB and SIN and the expression of ST5b-Bol026201, between the PRO and GRA levels and AOP2-Bo2g102190 expression, and between the GIV level and ST5b-Bol026202 and ST5c-Bol030757 expression. In contrast, no significant positive correlation was found for GNA and GER (Figure 5A, Supplementary File S4). Among indole GSLs, the GBS level showed significant positive correlation with MYB122-Bol026204, ST5a-Bol026200, ST5a-Bol039395, IGMT1-Bol007029, and IGMT2-Bol007030 expression, the HGBS level with MYB34-Bol036262 and CYP81F3-Bol028919 expression, and the MGBS level with MYB34-Bol036262, MYB122-Bol026204, ST5a-Bol026200, ST5a-Bol039395, and IGMT2-Bol007030 expression, whereas the NGBS level had the highest significant positive correlation with MYB34-Bol007760 expression (Figure 5B, Supplementary File S4). Principal component analysis (PCA) for the contents of the 11 individual GSL compounds under five different treatment combinations in the R line SCNU-C-049 and the S line SCNU-C-033 of cabbage that we tested revealed an association between white mold resistance and the pattern of GSL accumulation. There were major contrasts among the contents of the individual GSLs. The first four PCs explained 88.3% of the total variation in the datasets (Table S5). PC1 and PC2 accounted for 43.5% and 24.2% of the total variation, respectively, largely corresponding to higher positive coefficients versus lower negative coefficients of individual GSL profiles (Table S5). PC1 clearly distinguished the R line from the S line, based on individual GSL profiles (Figure 6 and Table S5) for their positive and negative coefficients respectively. PC2, on the other hand, showed positive association with GIV and GBS in infected samples at 3 DPI (T3) for their positive coefficients, compared to the mock-treated and control samples for their negative coefficients (Figure 6)."}, "24502855": {"doi": "10.1186/1471-2164-15-107", "title": "Genome survey sequencing provides clues into glucosinolate biosynthesis and flowering pathway evolution in allotetrapolyploid Brassica juncea", "abstract": "BackgroundBrassica juncea is an economically important vegetable crop in China, oil crop in India, condiment crop in Europe and selected for canola quality recently in Canada and Australia. B. juncea (2n = 36, AABB) is an allotetraploid derived from interspecific hybridization between B. rapa (2n = 20, AA) and B. nigra (2n = 16, BB), followed by spontaneous chromosome doubling.ResultsComparative genome analysis by genome survey sequence (GSS) of allopolyploid B. juncea with B. rapa was carried out based on high-throughput sequencing approaches. Over 28.35 Gb of GSS data were used for comparative analysis of B. juncea and B. rapa, producing 45.93% reads mapping to the B. rapa genome with a high ratio of single-end reads. Mapping data suggested more structure variation (SV) in the B. juncea genome than in B. rapa. We detected 2,921,310 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with high heterozygosity and 113,368 SVs, including 1-3 bp Indels, between B. juncea and B. rapa. Non-synonymous polymorphisms in glucosinolate biosynthesis genes may account for differences in glucosinolate biosynthesis and glucosinolate components between B. juncea and B. rapa. Furthermore, we identified distinctive vernalization-dependent and photoperiod-dependent flowering pathways coexisting in allopolyploid B. juncea, suggesting contribution of these pathways to adaptation for survival during polyploidization.ConclusionsTaken together, we proposed that polyploidization has allowed for accelerated evolution of the glucosinolate biosynthesis and flowering pathways in B. juncea that likely permit the phenotypic variation observed in the crop.", "intro": "BackgroundThe Brassicaceae family includes approximately 3,700 species in 350 genera with diverse characteristics, many of which are of agronomic importance as vegetables, condiments, fodder and oil crops. The genus Brassica contains the majority of crop species of Brassicaceae family. Of particular importance are the cole crop and vegetable species B. rapa, B. oleracea, B. napus, and B. juncea as sources of oils and vegetables. Because of their agricultural importance, genome components of several Brassica species have been characterized in detail over the past few years. The genomes of three diploid species, B. rapa (AA, 2n = 20), B. nigra (BB, 2n = 16), and B. oleracea (CC, 2n = 18), have been shown to contain triplicate homologous counterparts of corresponding segments in the Arabidopsis genome due to whole-genome triplication that occurred approximately 12-17 million years ago. Additional natural allopolyploidization events in the last 10,000 years, have resulted in the creation of three allotetraploid hybrids, B. juncea (AABB, 2n = 36), B. napus (AACC, 2n = 38) and B. carinata (BBCC, 2n = 34). B. juncea is used as a vegetable in China and Southeastern Asia, and is a source of oil in India and Europe. The species possesses unique traits that include much wider morphological variation in leafy types, root type, stem type, seed stalk type and oil type. B. juncea has been reported to contain higher glucosinolates than other Brassica species. Glucosinolates are of higher value to human nutrition that may reduce the risk of cancer incidence. In addition, they are toxic to some soil-borne plant pathogens, hence, accounting for their selection.The recent accomplishment of genome sequencing and annotation of B. rapa, combined with the available genome sequence data for model Arabidopsis in Brassicaceae, provide improved strategies for comparative genome analysis and breeding. Attempts to develop a unified comparative genomics system in the Brassicaceae have revealed 24 conserved genomic blocks, an extension to the 21 syntenic blocks identified in B. napus. Comparative mapping studies between members of Brassica and Arabidopsis thaliana, and Arabidopsis thaliana and Capsella rubella, together with the identification of an ancestral karyotype (AK), have stimulated interest in the evolutionary processes underlying diversification in the Brassicaceae. Since the allotetraploid species possess much larger genomes than their diploid counterparts in Brassica, we expect that novel gene/pathway interactions have emerged in the allotetraploid Brassica species through sub-functionalization and/or neo-functionalization of paralogs.Low coverage genome survey sequences (GSS) can provide information about gene content, polymorphism, functional elements, repetitive elements and molecular markers. In some studies, most of the coding sequence in a genome can be surveyed with less than 2 genome coverage. It was possible to recover 38% of the coding fraction of the mouse-human alignment with only 0.66 x coverage of the pig genome. With only 0.1 x coverage, it was possible to generate a considerable amount of biologically useful information and genomic resources for Megaselia scalaris, including identification of repetitive elements, the mitochondrial genome, microsatellites and identification of gene homologs. These studies make a compelling case for low density sequencing in the genomic studies of non-model species.Here, we employed high-throughput sequencing for comparative genome analysis of B. juncea and B. rapa to identify genome changes associated with polyploidization that might account for the phenotypic diversity of B. juncea. We showed clues of glucosinolate biosynthesis and flowering pathway evolution occurred in Brassica juncea, likely accounting for some of the phenotypic diversity that is observed. Furthermore, it provides a valuable resource for more focused investigations into the rate and distribution of genomic changes that accompany polyploidization in this species.", "results": "ResultsKaryotype of B. junceaAccording to the 'U-triangle' theory of Brassicaceae, allotetraploid B. juncea originated from hybridization of B. rapa (AA, 2n = 20) and B. nigra (BB, 2n = 16). We identified genomic components of B. juncea by genomic in situ hybridization (GISH). The two predicted genomes (A and B) of the allotetraploid were distinguished using genomic DNA from B. rapa and B. nigra as probes representing the putative progenitor genomes. The 20 A and 16 B chromosomes detected suggest that the two genomes have remained somewhat distinct in B. juncea with no significant genome homogenization and no large-scale translocations between genomes (Figure 1).Comparative genome analysis of B. juncea and B. rapaAfter quality evaluation of sequencing data (Additional file 1: Figure S1), a total of 28.35 Gb high quality data were collected for the B. juncea genome and used to compare with whole genome sequence of B. rapa. It was feasible to map 45.93% sequences of the B. juncea GSS data to the genome sequences of B. rapa. Of these, only 18.44% single-end reads were mapped to the genome sequences of B. rapa, which indicated more SV in the B. juncea genome compared to B. rapa. The identity of mapped sequences is 98.14%, which shows a close genetic relationship between B. juncea and B. rapa (Additional file 1: Table S1). The coverage depth and distribution on chromosomes suggest a high comparison ratio over the B. rapa genome (Additional file 1: Figure S2).Polymorphism analysis identified 2,921,310 SNPs, including 58.53% transitions, 41.47% transversions and 58.19% heterozygosity. We showed the distributions of SNP-type in 10 chromosomes of B. rapa genome (Additional file 1: Table S2, Additional file 1: Figure S3). 44,053 SVs were detected as insertions and deletions, with approximately even distributions of SVs across the 10 chromosomes of B. rapa genome (Additional file 1: Table S3, Additional file 1: Figure S3). 69,315 Indel (1-3 bp) polymorphisms were also observed, of which 1 bp-sized Indels were most abundant in genome and 3 bp-sized Indels were most abundant in coding sequence (Additional file 1: Table S4, Additional file 1: Figure S3). Most SNPs and SVs (including 1-3 bp Indels) were located in exon, intron, transposon, intergenic, TEprotein, TandemRepeat region of genome, others were found in miRNA, tRNA and snRNA coding regions of genome (Table 1). These SNPs cause a relatively high ratio of non-synonymous mutations in genes; for example, 9680 genes were found with ( 10) non-synonymous SNPs. Moreover, 1448 genes coding regions were changed by frame-shift Indels, and we also found 5989 genes have SV within gene coding regions (Table 2). A number of gene functions were found to be altered by these mutations based on Non-Redundant Nucleotide Database (NT/NR), Cluster of Othologues Groups Proteins Database (COG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes Database (KEGG) database searches (data not shown). Here, we have focused on glucosinolate biosynthesis and flowering pathways in particular.Glucosinolate biosynthesis genes expression between B. juncea and B. rapaWe constructed glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway in B. juncea by KEGG analysis. Three biosynthesis pathways were identified from different substrates including methionine, branched-chain amino acid and aromatic amino acid (Figure 2). Among glucosinolate biosynthesis-related genes, we found non-synonymous SNPs and deletion/insertion SV polymorphisms in CYP79F1 (CYP, cytochromes P450), CYP83A1, SUR1 (SUPERROOT1), UGT74B1 (UDP-glucose:thiohydroximate S-glucosyltransferase), SOT16 (sulfotransferase), CYP79A2, CYP83B1, CYP79B2 and CYP79B3 genes (Additional file 1: Table S5), which suggested different genes expressions and glucosinolate components and contents. Gene expression of 6 selected glucosinolate biosynthesis-related genes were investigated in leaves between B. juncea and B. rapa. CYP83A1, CYP79A2 and CYP79F1 expressions were up-regulated in B. juncea than B. rapa. CYP83B1 expression was down-regulated in B. juncea than B. rapa. There was no difference in CYP79B2 and SUR1 expressions between B. juncea and B. rapa (Figure 3). These mutations appear to cause differences in gene expression and glucosinolate content between B. juncea and B. rapa.Glucosinolate component and content between B. juncea and B. rapaWe checked glucosinolate component and content between B. juncea and B. rapa by HPLC. Of glucosinolate component, sinigrin, gluconapin, glucobrassicanapin, glucobrassicin and 4-Methoxy glucobrassicin were detected in young leaves of B. juncea, of which sinigrin showed very high content with 19.58 mu mol/g DW in leaves. Only glucobrassicin, 4-Methoxy glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin were detected in young leaves of B. rapa (Figure 4).The flowering pathway in Brassica junceaFlowering behavior is an essential feature affecting Brassicaecae crop production. For B. rapa (AA genome), seed vernalization and long-day photoperiod conditions are necessary for flowering (Figure 5-A, B), while only long-day photoperiod conditions promote B. nigra flowering, without any need for vernalization treatment (Figure 5-A, B). Interestingly, long-day photoperiod conditions lead to flowering in B. juncea regardless of vernalization conditions (Figure 5-C, D). We identified four FLOWERING LOCI C (FLC1, FLC2, FLC3 and FLC5) genes and other flowering pathway-related genes, including CONSTANS (CO), CONSTANS -like (COL), FLOWERING T (FT), LEAFY, SOC1 (SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO1) and AP1 (APETALA1), in B. juncea. Under vernalization and long-day photoperiod conditions, when FLCs gene expression is down-regulated, flowering occurs by an FLC-dependent pathway in B. juncea. Under non-vernalization and long-day photoperiod conditions, flowering occurs by a CONSTANS-dependent pathway, not FLC-dependent, since FLCs genes are still expressed during flowering (Figure 5-E). These results indicate that vernalization- and photoperiod-dependent flowering pathways coexist in the allotetraploid B. juncea (Figure 5-F)."}, "28094342": {"doi": "10.1038/srep40807", "title": "Optimizing isothiocyanate formation during enzymatic glucosinolate breakdown by adjusting pH value, temperature and dilution in Brassica vegetables and Arabidopsis thaliana", "abstract": "Consumption of glucosinolate-rich Brassicales vegetables is associated with a decreased risk of cancer with enzymatic hydrolysis of glucosinolates playing a key role. However, formation of health-promoting isothiocyanates is inhibited by the epithiospecifier protein in favour of nitriles and epithionitriles. Domestic processing conditions, such as changes in pH value, temperature or dilution, might also affect isothiocyanate formation. Therefore, the influences of these three factors were evaluated in accessions of Brassica rapa, Brassica oleracea, and Arabidopsis thaliana. Mathematical modelling was performed to determine optimal isothiocyanate formation conditions and to obtain knowledge on the kinetics of the reactions. At 22  C and endogenous plant pH, nearly all investigated plants formed nitriles and epithionitriles instead of health-promoting isothiocyanates. Response surface models, however, clearly demonstrated that upon change in pH to domestic acidic (pH 4) or basic pH values (pH 8), isothiocyanate formation considerably increases. While temperature also affects this process, the pH value has the greatest impact. Further, a kinetic model showed that isothiocyanate formation strongly increases due to dilution. Finally, the results show that isothiocyanate intake can be strongly increased by optimizing the conditions of preparation of Brassicales vegetables.", "intro": "Brassicales plants, including Arabidopsis thaliana, broccoli, cabbage and pak choi contain glucosinolates (GLSs). These sulphur-containing secondary plant metabolites not only play an important role in the plant's defense against biotic stressors, but also affect the taste of these vegetables and contribute to human health. To date, a total of 130 GLSs have been identified that can be subdivided according to the structure of their variable side chain into the group of aliphatic, aromatic or indole GLS. These plant metabolites are stored in the plant vacuole or in specialized S-cells, but upon cell disruption, they encounter the endogenous GLS-hydrolysing enzyme myrosinase, a beta-d-thioglucosidase, and the GLSs will be hydrolysed to release isothiocyanates (ITCs), nitriles and epithionitriles (EPTs).Due to their electrophilicity, GLSs in general and ITCs in particular act as effective deterrents against a multitude of pathogens as these compounds have antifungal, antimicrobial as well as insecticidal properties. For humans, ITCs, such as the 4-(methylsulphinyl)butyl ITC (4MSOB-ITC), exert a multitude of health beneficial effects, including antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, antithrombotic and chemopreventive effects. In additional, consumption of Brassica vegetables has been associated with a decreased risk to several types of cancer. On the other hand, nitriles and EPTs were shown to have less health beneficial potential and even to exert some harmful effects, especially in animal nutrition. Therefore, in respect to a healthy human diet, it is of great interest to provide food rich in ITCs with low levels of nitriles and EPTs.To better understand the complexity of generating ITC-rich foods, it is of great importance to comprehend the enzymatic hydrolysis process of GLS. When myrosinase and GLS come into contact, d-glucose is cleaved and an instable aglucon, the thiohydroximate-O-sulphate, is released. l-Ascorbate is a cofactor for myrosinase since it promotes the rate-limiting step of the reaction, i.e. the release of the glucose molecule from the active site of myrosinase. The aglucon is unstable and spontaneously rearranges either via a Lossen rearrangement to form the ITC, the pungent principle of, e.g. mustard, or degrades releasing sulphur to form a nitrile. Some ITCs, such as indole-ITC or ITC from 2-hydroxyalkenyl GLS, are very instable and form the respective indole-3-carbinols by release of thiocyanate anion (SCN-) or cyclize to the respective oxazolidine-2-thiones. The spontaneous formation of nitriles is favoured at low pH values, as protons block the Lossen rearrangement. Further, if an alkenyl GLS and the epithiospecifier protein (ESP) are present, the degradation process of the aglucon can be modified and an EPT can be released (Fig. 1). Moreover, the ESP has also been identified to favour nitrile formation from other (non-alkenyl) GLS. The activity of this protein was shown to be dependent on ferrous ions (Fe2+). In additional, in A. thaliana, other modifying proteins can be present and the so-called nitrile specifier proteins (NSPs) also play a role in the degradation of the aglucon. Thus, in the presence of NSPs, the formation of nitriles is favoured, whereas the epithiospecifier modifier protein (ESM) blocks EPT and nitrile formation to promote ITC formation. On the other hand, a fourth class of specifier proteins, namely the thiocyanate-forming protein (TFP), was reported to catalyse the formation of benzylthiocyanate in Lepidium sativum. As many Brassica vegetables, among them broccoli, cabbage and pak choi, contain ESP, nitriles and EPTs instead of ITCs can be the resultant main breakdown products. Moreover, many Brassica vegetables are thermally processed prior to consumption and this changes ITC formation dramatically. Whereas mild heat treatment was shown to inhibit the activity of the thermally labile ESP and thus favours ITC formation, more intense heat treatment also inactivates the myrosinase. However, then GLS can be still degraded because of thermal degradation, but mainly nitriles will be formed, while the ITCs will be degraded due to the heat. Moreover, during cooking, GLS content of vegetables often decreases due to leaching effects. Thus, thermal processing often reduces ITC formation and uptake. Ingested intact GLS, however, can also be degraded by human microbial myrosinases in the colon, and subsequently, ITC can be formed.Therefore, enzymatic hydrolysis of GLS plays an important role in the biofunctionality of GLS breakdown product related cancer prevention. However, additional factors, e.g. the pH value during vegetable slicing or also in the mouth during chewing, as well as the preparation temperature of the vegetable, might also affect the enzymatic hydrolysis and subsequent reaction pathways, and ultimately, the ITC concentration. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of (1) \"refrigerator\" (4  C), ambient (22  C) and \"chewing\" temperature (37  C) as well as (2) acidic (pH 4), medium (pH 6) and slightly basic pH values (pH 8), that are relevant for food preparation, on the profile of enzymatic breakdown products of GLS in selected Brassica vegetables. For this purpose, Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea were compared to the model plant A. thaliana. The two B. rapa accessions (B. rapa ssp. rapa and B. rapa ssp. oleifera) were chosen because of their different content in unsaturated aliphatic GLS (pre-experiment), whereas BroccoCress  (B. oleracea var. italica) was selected due to its GLS profile and popularity as a mini green vegetable. In addition, selected accessions of the model plant A. thaliana (Bur-0, Hi-0) were chosen as this plant is well characterized for its GLS hydrolysis proteins (e.g. ESP, ESM, NSP 1-5). Bur-0 and Hi-0 are both rich in 2Prop-GLS, but differ in their hydrolysis behaviour. In detail, Hi-0 forms ITCs, while Bur-0 releases EPTs. Moreover, we also evaluated whether the hydrolysis process of GLS in Brassica vegetables can be modified by dilution with water, artificial saliva or heat-treated plant homogenate, e.g. by changing the concentration of GLS, myrosinase and specifier proteins present in the environment during GLS hydrolysis. Next to the B. rapa plants and the BroccoCress  mini greens of white cabbage (B. oleracea convar. capitata var. alba) were also evaluated since they differ in their GLS profile compared to BroccoCress . The results of these studies were modelled, in order (1) to determine the impact of pH, temperature and dilution and to compare the various species belonging to the Brassicaceae family as regards their GLS metabolism as well as (2) to obtain knowledge on the kinetics of the hydrolysis and breakdown reactions as a first step in optimizing ITC formation, and thus intake, during the food preparation process.", "results": "ResultsIn addition to quantification of the GLS breakdown products under the different pH, temperature and dilution conditions, the plant materials were evaluated for their GLS content, myrosinase activity, ESP activity and l-ascorbic acid (vitamin C) content.Glucosinolates in Brassica rapa, Brassica oleracea and Arabidopsis thalianaIn the six different plants, 16 different GLSs were detected with aliphatic GLSs being the most abundant (see Supplementary Information). B. rapa BR215 and BR374 mainly contained 3-butenyl GLS (3But-GLS) (0.3 and 1.1 mumol/g fresh weight (FW)) and 4-pentenyl GLS (0.2 and 0.4 mumol/g FW), whereas the B. oleracea BroccoCress  was rich in 4-(methylsulphinyl)butyl GLS (4MSOB-GLS) and 4-(methylthio)butyl GLS (4MTB-GLS) (5.9 and 1.1 mumol/g FW, respectively). The white cabbage sprouts mainly contained 2-propenyl GSL (2Prop-GLS) and 3-(methylsulphinyl)propyl GLS (3MSOP-GLS) (1.2 and 0.6 mumol/g FW, respectively). The A. thaliana plants were rich in alkenyl GLS: Bur-0 had high levels of 3But-GLS and 2Prop-GLS (2.9 and 1.8 mumol/g DW), while Hi-0 was only rich in 2Prop-GLS (5.1 mumol/g DW). With regard to the GLS content in the heat-treated plant homogenates (inactivated plant material), the same main GLSs were detected as compared to the non-treated material. While myrosinase-inactivated BR215 and BR374 had lower GLS concentrations compared to the native material, myrosinase-inactivated BroccoCress  had the same GLS concentrations and white cabbage sprout material had even higher extractable concentrations.Myrosinase activity, ESP activity and l-ascorbic acid contentMyrosinase activity, ESP activity as well as l-ascorbic acid content differed between the plants (Table 1). Bur-0 followed by BroccoCress  had the highest myrosinase activities (MYR), whereas white cabbage sprouts had the lowest myrosinase activity. With respect to ESP activity, A. thaliana Bur-0 also had the highest percentage of 1-cyano-2,3-epithiopropane (CETP) relative to all degradation products from 2Prop-GLS followed by BroccoCress , while the A. thaliana Hi-0 had the lowest ESP activity. The B. rapa accession BR215 and BR374 plants as well as white cabbage sprouts had medium ESP activities. With regard to the ratio of ESP/myrosinase activity (ESP/MYR), white cabbage sprouts had the highest ratio, followed by BR215, BR374, Bur-0 and BroccoCress  plants which had a ratio of 7 to 17-times less. For Hi-0, the ratio was more than a 100-fold less compared to the white cabbage sprouts. With regard to the overall activity of myrosinase per mumol of (total) GLS (MYR/GLS), again Bur-0 had the highest (79 U/mumol), followed by BR215, BroccoCress , BR374 and Hi-0 (50, 43, 17 and 15 U/mumol, respectively). In contrast, white cabbage sprouts had a distinct lower amount of myrosinase per mumol of GLS (0.9 U/mumol). With respect to ESP activity relative to the GLS content (ESP/GLS), again, Bur-0, together with BR215, had the highest level, followed by BroccoCress , BR374 and the white cabbage sprouts, while the ESP/GLS ratio of Hi-0 was lowest. All Brassicaceae plants used for the experiment on the effect of pH and temperature were also analysed for their l-ascorbic acid content as this is an important cofactor for myrosinase. The l-ascorbic acid concentration ranged from 0.6 to 31.5 mg/100 g FW. While BR215 had the highest l-ascorbic acid content, white cabbage sprouts had the lowest (Table 1).Glucosinolate breakdown products in B. rapa, B. oleracea and A. thalianaUpon cell disruption, GLS in Brassica and Arabidopsis plants are hydrolysed by myrosinase and resulting ITCs, nitriles or EPTs are formed. In the six plants analysed, a total of 26 breakdown products were identified (see Supplementary Information). Upon hydrolysis (at 22  C with a water/plant ratio of 2:1), all plants except for Hi-0, formed mainly EPT and nitriles, whereas Hi-0 mainly produced ITC. Nevertheless, BroccoCress  had the highest concentration of total ITC, which was mainly attributed to the cancer preventive compound, 4MSOB-ITC (sulforaphane). In general, the two B. rapa accessions BR215 and BR274 and Bur-0 mainly formed the EPT 1-cyano-3,4-epithiobutane (CETB), with BR374 and Bur-0 being very rich in this GLS breakdown product (more than 1 mumol/g FW). While BR374 also contained noteworthy amounts of the corresponding 3-butenyl ITC (3But-ITC), Bur-0 was also rich in CETP, that was also the main breakdown product found in white cabbage sprouts. In contrast, Hi-0 mainly formed the corresponding 2-propenyl isothiocyanate (2Prop-ITC). Finally, BroccoCress  was a producer of nitriles and rich in 5-(methylsulphinyl)pentanenitrile (4MSOB-CN) and 5-(methylthio)pentanenitrile (4MTB-CN). Nevertheless, it also contained 0.6 mumol of 4MSOB-ITC.Effect of temperature and pH value on the enzymatic hydrolysis of glucosinolatesIn many Brassica vegetables, most GLSs form mainly EPT and nitriles instead of ITC. It is thus of great interest to identify factors that might shift the breakdown towards ITC formation.During food processing, the temperature of the vegetables or a modified pH value might have an effect on which GLS breakdown products are formed. Therefore, by adding a solution of 0.1 M acetic acid (acidic) or 0.1 M sodium carbonate (alkaline), the pH value was modified and effects were tested in combination with the typical domestic preparation temperatures of 4, 22 and 37  C.With regard to the endogenous plant's pH values, BroccoCress  had the lowest pH value (pH 5.6), while BR215, BR374 and Bur-0 had a pH value of 6.3, and Hi-0 of 6.4. After addition of the acidic or alkaline solution, the pH values dropped or increased. Thus, the corresponding acidic pH value of the plants was 3.6 (BroccoCress ) or 4.2 for the other Brassicaceae plants, whereas the corresponding basic pH value was 8.0 (Bur-0), 8.2 (Hi-0, BroccoCress ) or 8.3 (BR215 and BR274).Response surface modellingTo determine the effect of the independent parameters of pH value and temperature on the main GLS breakdown products, response surface modelling was performed using the relative amounts (%) of the ITC, nitrile and EPT derived from the main GLS. The obtained data for the models are presented in Table 2. For all main compounds of the plants, significant response surface models could be calculated, except for the ITC and EPT deriving from the main GLS of Bur-0 and for 4MTB-GLS hydrolysis in BroccoCress , (Table 2). As a basic equation for all response surface models, the following equation 1 can be given:with A being the pH and B being the temperature.With two exceptions, quadratic or reduced quadratic (without one or two of the coefficients) models were calculated for the breakdown products of the main GLS in these plants: For Hi-0-derived CETP, a 2Fl-model (2-factor interaction; without quadratic terms) was used, while for 4-pentenylnitrile (3But-CN) in Bur-0, a linear model was employed (Table 2) (without quadratic terms, without interaction of A and B).With regard to the B. rapa accessions, namely BR215 and BR374, the 3D models obtained for 3But-ITC, 3But-CN and CETB are similar, and thus, only the 3D model graphs for BR215 are shown in Fig. 2. The results for 2Prop breakdown products for Hi-0 are presented in Fig. 3 and the effect of pH and temperature on 4MSOB-GLS degradation in BroccoCress  is depicted in Fig. 4.In all plants except Bur-0, the pH value had a great impact on ITC formation. While at the endogenous plant's pH value, the formation of EPTs (BR215, BR374) (Fig. 2C) or nitriles (BroccoCress ) (Fig. 4B) was very prominent, at acidic or alkaline conditions, the formation of ITCs increased (compare Figs 2A, 3A and 4A). In Hi-0, although mainly 2Prop-ITC was formed, low and high pH increased the percentage of 2Prop-ITC (Fig. 3A) and reduced 3-butenenitrile (2Prop-CN, Fig. 3B). The formation of nitriles in the presence of high EPT concentrations was differently affected in the plants. While in BR215, an acidic pH increased nitriles considerably (Fig. 2B), the effect was less pronounced on the main nitriles of BR374 or Bur-0 (Table 2). Similar to the pH value, temperature also significantly affected the formation of ITCs, EPTs and nitriles and interactive effects of pH and temperature were also present (Table 2). In BR215, BR374, Hi-0 and BroccoCress , formation of ITC and EPT was affected by the temperature, but the effect was distinctly lower compared to the effect of pH (compare Figs 2, 3 and 4 and Table 2). For example, models identified that in BR215 at both acidic and alkaline pH, 3But-ITC formation is highest at lower ambient temperature (16-18  C) and decreases at high or low temperatures (Fig. 2A). In contrast, in BroccoCress  at a given pH value, 4MSOB-ITC increases with higher temperature (Fig. 4A). In Hi-0, the effect of temperature on ITC and nitrile formation is limited, but has an effect on CETP formation, which is increased at acidic pH with rising temperature (Fig. 3C). Although there was no suitable model for Bur-0, at acidic pH, the percentage of the nitriles and ITC from 2Prop-GLS and 3But-GSL at 37  C were higher compared to the other temperatures, while the percentage of EPT was lower (see Supplementary Information, tested by one-way ANOVA and Tukey's HSD test, STATISTICA version10). With respect to optimized ITC formation, the models predicted optimal ITC formation in BroccoCress  and Hi-0 to be at basic pH value and 37  C (Figs 3A and 4A), while in BR215 acidic pH and 4  C are the optimal conditions for ITC formation (Fig. 2A). In BR374, ITC formation could be optimized both at acidic and alkaline pH value at lower ambient temperature (16-18  C).Effect of dilution on the enzymatic hydrolysis of glucosinolatesTo identify additional optimization strategies for ITC formation during the enzymatic hydrolysis of GLS, we tested whether different dilution formulas and intensities have an influence on the type of GLS breakdown products. Note that at lower ESP concentration, the spontaneous, non-catalysed formation of ITC from the aglucon might be favoured because the probability should decline that the ESP meets the aglucon. Thus, we studied the following dilution patterns: (1) fresh plant material was diluted with water at 22  C as relevant for juice preparation; (2) artificial saliva was used at 37  C, thereby simulating hydrolysis under chewing conditions; and (3) dilution with myrosinase- and ESP-inactivated plant material at 22  C, thus imitating hydrolysis in cooked samples, e.g. when cooked and fresh materials are mixed during food preparation. The inactivated plant material still contained GLS (see Supplementary Information), while breakdown products were usually present only in very small amounts. The concentrations of breakdown products in the myrosinase inactivated materials are presented in the Supplementary Information. In the inactivated material of the two B. rapa only 3But-ITC was present in low amounts (0.09% and 3.1% compared to the 3But-GSL hydrolysis products of fresh tissue). In the inactivated white cabbage sprouts traces of 2Prop-CN (0.8% compared to the 2Prop-GSL hydrolysis products in fresh tissue) and of 2Prop-ITC (0.08% compared to the 2Prop-GSL hydrolysis products in fresh tissue) were present. In myrosinase inactivated BroccoCress , in comparison slightly higher amounts of nitriles and traces of ITC were present: 4MTB-CN (6.8% compared to the 4MTB-GSL hydrolysis products of fresh tissue), 4MTB-ITC (0.42% compared to the 4MTB-GSL hydrolysis products of fresh tissue) and 4MSOB-CN (9.1% compared to the 4MSOB-GSL hydrolysis products of fresh tissue) were detected. Thus, here in the BroccoCress , approx. up to 8% of the 4MSOB-CN formed in the highest dilution level could be attributed to the basis level originated from the inactive material. Upon hydrolysis of the GLSs for all three diluents types, mainly EPTs and nitriles were formed at low dilution with the notable exception of the experiment using saliva and BroccoCress . The determined absolute concentrations of hydrolysis products are presented in the Supplementary Information. For all diluents and in all plants studied, absolute EPT or nitrile concentrations decreased with increasing dilution and (except in BR215 where no effect on absolute ITC concentrations was observable) ITC concentrations increased (compare Supplementary Information). To generate models to predict the effect of various dilution patterns as well as to obtain additional information on the kinetics of the reactions involved in GLS hydrolysis, modelling was performed using the percentages of the respective breakdown products formed from the corresponding main GLS.On the basis of the reactions presented in Fig. 1, models for breakdown product formation from EPT-forming alkenyl-GLS were evolved. The reaction constants k1-4 were labelled according to the degradation reactions presented in Fig. 1. The following equations were used for the B. rapa accessions BR215 and BR374, and white cabbage sprouts. The kinetic Excel-model pointed out that k3 = 0. Therefore, equations could be simplified and either k1 and k4 or x1 = k1/k2 and x4 = k4/k2 could be calculated.For the non-EPT-forming BroccoCress , the model equations for 4MSOB-GLS and 4MTB-GLS breakdown could be simplified:The results are presented in Table 3. In Fig. 5, the models obtained for the effect of dilution on the hydrolysis of 2Prop-GLS in white cabbage sprouts and 4MSOB-GLS in BroccoCress  are presented.Upon dilution, ITC formation increased in all experiments. This increase was inversely correlated with the corresponding EPT formation (Fig. 5A-C) or for BroccoCress , with the formation of the respective 4MSOB-CN (Fig. 5D-F) and 4MTB-CN. For example, upon dilution with water (17-fold dilution compared to 2-fold), 3But-ITC content in BR215 and BR374, increased by 8.9- and 3.1-fold, respectively. In BroccoCress , 4MSOB-ITC increased by 2.4 fold and in white cabbage sprouts 2Prop-ITC increased by 2.1-fold (see Supplementary Information). With regard to the three diluent types, ITC formation, even at the lowest dilution level (2-fold dilution), differed. In detail, ITC concentration was highest in the saliva buffer (4MSOB-ITC in BroccoCress , Fig. 5E) or in the myrosinase-inactivated plant material (BR215, see Supplementary Information; white cabbage sprouts, Fig. 5C; 4MTB-ITC in BroccoCress , see Supplementary Information), while the ITC concentration in the diluent water was usually lowest (see Supplementary Information, Fig. 5A,D).Moreover, the degradation of GLS was differently affected by the diluents and in white cabbage sprouts, the highest 2Prop-ITC concentrations were formed upon hydrolysis and dilution with myrosinase-inactivated white cabbage material (Fig. 5C). The models obtained for the effect of dilution on ITC formation in BroccoCress  were similar to the white cabbage sprouts (compare Fig. 5A-C with 5D-F), with the exception of artificial saliva for which 4MSOB-ITC was the main breakdown product of 4MSOB GLS (Fig. 5E). The hydrolysis of 4MTB-GLS in BroccoCress  to ITC was similarly affected by the diluents compared to 2Prop-GLS hydrolysis in white cabbage sprouts (Table 3). The models for the B. rapa accessions BR215 and BR374 were highly correlated and therefore less significant (Table 3).With regard to the kinetics of the reaction rate, constants k1 and k4 (model BroccoCress ) and x1 = k1/k2 and x4 = k4/k2 (other dilution plant models) could be calculated. In all models, x1 or k2, both indicating the ESP-dependent reaction to the respective EPT or nitrile, were higher compared to x4 or the respective k4-value (indicating ITC formation) (Table 3). Between the diluents, significant differences between the rate constants were observed for BroccoCress  and for white cabbage sprouts. The factor x4 or the respective k4 constant of the diluent water were always lower than those of the other diluents. In white cabbage sprouts, x1 was two times larger in the water compared to the other diluents and the x4 value was 3.9 times higher in the saliva buffer and 5.5 times greater in the myrosinase-inactivated plant material compared to the diluent water. In BroccoCress , k2 constants of 4MSOB-GLS and 4MTB-GLS (ESP-mediated reaction to the nitrile) were equal among the diluents (around 1), whereas the k4 constant of 4MSOB-GLS was 12.4-fold higher and 4MTB-GLS was only 4-times increased in the saliva buffer compared to the k4 constant of the water. When diluted with myrosinase-inactivated BroccoCress  material, k4 of 4MSOB-GLS was 2.6-fold higher and k4 of 4MTB-GLS was 6.8-fold higher compared to k4 of the diluent water (Table 3)."}, "25362058": {"doi": "10.1128/AEM.03142-14"}, "34418959": {"doi": "10.1186/s12870-021-03168-2", "title": "Comparative transcriptomic analyses of glucosinolate metabolic genes during the formation of Chinese kale seeds", "abstract": "BackgroundTo understand the mechanism of glucosinolates (GSs) accumulation in the specific organs, combined analysis of physiological change and transcriptome sequencing were applied in the current study. Taking Chinese kale as material, seeds and silique walls were divided into different stages based on the development of the embryo in seeds and then subjected to GS analysis and transcriptome sequencing.ResultsThe main GS in seeds of Chinese kale were glucoiberin and gluconapin and their content changed with the development of the seed. During the transition of the embryo from torpedo- to the early cotyledonary-embryo stage, the accumulation of GS in the seed was accompanied by the salient decline of GS in the corresponding silique wall. Thus, the seed and corresponding silique wall at these two stages were subjected to transcriptomic sequencing analysis. 135 genes related to GS metabolism were identified, of which 24 genes were transcription factors, 81 genes were related to biosynthetic pathway, 25 genes encoded catabolic enzymes, and 5 genes matched with transporters. The expression of GS biosynthetic genes was detected both in seeds and silique walls. The high expression of FMOGS-OX and AOP2, which is related to the production of gluconapin by side modification, was noted in seeds at both stages. Interestingly, the expression of GS biosynthetic genes was higher in the silique wall compared with that in the seed albeit lower content of GS existed in the silique wall than in the seed. Combined with the higher expression of transporter genes GTRs in silique walls than in seeds, it was proposed that the transportation of GS from the silique wall to the seed is an important source for seed GS accumulation. In addition, genes related to GS degradation expressed abundantly in the seed at the early cotyledonary-embryo stage indicating its potential role in balancing seed GS content.ConclusionsTwo stages including the torpedo-embryo and the early cotyledonary-embryo stage were identified as crucial in GS accumulation during seed development. Moreover, we confirmed the transportation of GS from the silique wall to the seed and proposed possible sidechain modification of GS biosynthesis may exist during seed formation.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1186/s12870-021-03168-2.", "intro": "BackgroundChinese kale (B. oleracea), a member of the Cruciferae, is notable for its high content of glucosinolates (GS), which show excellent health-promoting properties, as well as rich contents of carotene and vitamin C. Chinese kale is a vegetable crop that originated in southern China and is a well-known specialty vegetable in China, with a crisp, tender, and unique flavor. Glucosinolates are a class of steroid glycosides synthesized from glucose and amino acids. These compounds widely occur as secondary metabolites in cruciferous species, especially Arabidopsis and a large number of economically valuable vegetables. Based on the amino acids from which the compounds are derived, GS can be categorized into aliphatic GS, indolic GS, and aromatic GS.In plants, GS localized within the vacuoles of specific cells. Upon herbivore damage, GS mix with the enzyme myrosinase (EC3.2.1) leading to the formation of breakdown products. The hydrolysis of indolic GS leads to the formation of unstable isothiocyanates (ITCs) and nitriles, whereas aliphatic and aromatic GS mostly produce noxious ITCs. Different GS groups endow plants with different resistance against distinct attackers. For example, indolic GSs act against phloem feeders and pathogens, whereas aliphatic, indolic, and benzyl GS may affect the performance of chewing insects.The GS content and profiles of GS are exceedingly diverse in different Chinese kale varieties. GSs are constitutively present in all tissues of brassicaceous plants, but differentially distributed over different organs, among which reproductive organs (e.g., seeds, pods, and developing inflorescences) have the highest GS content, followed by young leaves and roots. The accumulation of GS is a complex process that may be regulated by multiple mechanisms. The mediators that regulate GS accumulation are mainly related to three aspects of the process, that is: i) GS biosynthesis, ii) GS degradation, and iii) GS transportation. In the model plant Arabidopsis, the majority of GS biosynthetic and degradation genes have been identified. The synthesis of GS in Arabidopsis involves three independent processes: elongation of specific amino acids, formation of the core structure, and secondary modification of side chains. After comparison with the Arabidopsis genes, GS biosynthetic homologous genes were identified in Chinese kale sprouts in our previous study. The degradation of GS in plants may also exert an important influence on GS accumulation and is mediated by catabolic enzymes. Myrosinase, also known as beta-thioglucosidase, is a hydrolytic enzyme commonly present in cruciferous plants that efficiently degrade GSs. Six myrosinase genes (THIOGLUCOSIDE GLUCOHYDROLASE 1-6; TGG1-TGG6) have been identified in Arabidopsis. In addition, PENETRATION 2 (PEN2) and PYK10 are capable of hydrolyzing indolic GS in Arabidopsis. Recently, more than half of the beta-thioglucosidases in Arabidopsis were shown to exhibit myrosinase activity (BGLU18-BGLU39). In addition, transport processes are important for the reallocation of defensive compounds to protect tissues of high value in plants. As demonstrated in Arabidopsis, GSs are translocated to seeds at maturation by NITRATE TRANSPORTER 1/PEPTIDE TRANSPORTER (NRT1/PTR) family transporters. The NRT1/PTR family includes NPF2.10/GTR1, NPF2.11/GTR2, and NPF2.9/GTR3. Among these transporters, GTR1 and GTR2 are widely considered to show GS transport activity, whereas GTR3 specifically transports the indolic GS 3-ylmethyl glucosinolate.Vegetable crops harbor a greater number of homologous genes associated with GS biosynthesis than those identified in Arabidopsis. However, in Chinese kale, the homologs that play a crucial role in a specific metabolic process remain unknown, rendering it impossible to utilize gene editing for the improvement of vegetable quality. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA sequencing) is an efficient and widely used technique for acquiring deep transcriptome information and achieving a thorough understanding of biological transcripts, especially those involved in a metabolic pathway in a specific tissue. Simultaneously, RNA sequencing analysis is used to quantify transcript levels and also enables the identification of novel transcripts to improve the annotation of a genome. In a previous study, we have identified genes related to GS metabolism in Chinese kale sprouts. However, with the aim to improve the GS content in Chinese kale sprouts, we observed that the GS content in sprouts is the result of seed release, biosynthesis, degradation, and transport, among which seed release is a dominant factor affecting GS accumulation in sprouts. Therefore, an increase in the seed GS is crucial to regulate the GS content of Chinese kale sprouts.The distribution of GS over different parts follows optimal defense theory which allows plants to allocate defense compounds preferentially to the valuable plant parts which are also attractive to potential attackers. After domestication, varieties with high-value edible parts are selected, complicating the composition of GS in seeds. The in silico analysis of GS biosynthetic gene expression in Arabidopsis indicated the important role of GS allocation from silique walls to seeds. However, in Chinese kale, which contains different GS profiles compared with Arabidopsis, knowledge of sources for GS accumulation accompanying seed development is still limited. In the present study, we observed the decline of GS content in the silique wall and the increasing accumulation of GS in the seed during the development of the embryo in Chinse kale. Thus, we proposed that the accumulation of GS in the seed may be related to the transportation of GS from silique walls. By physiological analysis of GS accumulation with development of the seed and corresponding silique wall, we have identified the crucial stages for GS transition, that was torpedo- and cotyledonary-embryo, and these two stages were subjected to the transcriptome analysis after RNA sequencing. Finally, we concluded possible sidechain modification of GS may occur during seed formation in Chinese kale.", "results": "ResultsEmbryo development during Chinese kale seed formation and accumulation of GS in the seed and corresponding silique wallAfter the emergence of the flower bud, the entire process of floral and fruit development was tracked (Fig. 1A). Ten days after bud emergence, the flower was fully open and the silique was 10 mm in length (day 0). The silique grew quickly to a length of 35 mm at 9 days after flowering (DAF) and contained an embryo at the globular stage. A heart-shaped embryo had developed at 15 DAF in siliques 40-55 mm in length. A torpedo-shaped embryo was observed in siliques 55-65 mm in length at 31 DAF. The silique became green 10 days later by which time the embryo had entered the cotyledon stage. The cotyledonary-embryo stage lasted for 13 days until the silique became brown (Fig. 1A & B). The embryo diameter and seed size were measured from the globular to the cotyledonary stages (Fig. 1C). When the seed coat changed color from white to green, the embryo transited from the torpedo- to the early cotyledonary stage and a sharp increase in embryo diameter was detected without distinct change in seed size (Fig. 1A & C). The GS content of the seed and corresponding silique walls was measured at different developmental stages (Fig. 2). Eight kinds of GSs were identified including four kinds of aliphatic GSs (glucoiberin, progoitrin, gluconapin, and glucoerucin) and four kinds of indolic GSs (glucobrassicin, 4-hydroxybrassicin, 4-methoxyglucobrassicin, and neoglucobrassicin) (Supplemental Table 1). Two aliphatic GSs, namely the 3-carbon glucoiberin (GIB) and 4-carbon gluconapin (GNA) predominated in the seed and silique wall (Supplemental Table 1). Accumulation of GIB and GNA in the seeds followed a similar pattern; contents were relatively low before the torpedo-embryo stage, increased when the embryo entered the cotyledonary stage, and thereafter high contents were maintained until the embryo matured (Fig. 2A). The change in GS content in the corresponding silique walls exhibited the opposite trend, i.e., GS content was high when the silique grew from 10 to 65 mm long, and low after the seed coat became green (Fig. 2B). It is worth noting that the salient change in GS content was observed from the torpedo-embryo stage to the early cotyledonary-embryo stage, and opposite trends for GS accumulation in the seed and corresponding silique wall were observed, indicating that GS may be transferred from the silique wall to the seed during embryo maturation. Analysis of transcriptome in seeds and silique walls at torpedo- and cotyledonary-embryo stagesTo clarify the underlying mechanism of GS accumulation during seed formation, seeds and silique walls at the torpedo-embryo and the early cotyledonary-embryo stages were subjected to transcriptome sequencing. Twelve transcriptome databases, comprising seeds and silique walls at the torpedo-embryo stage (SC and PC, respectively) as well as seeds and silique walls at the early cotyledonary-embryo stage (SD and PD, respectively) with three replications of each group, were constructed.A total of 58.15 million raw reads was obtained with an average of 6.47 Gb data for each sample. After filtering, 43.12 million clean reads were mapped to the B. oleracea genome. The mapped percentage ranged from 80.66 to 84.51%. The average Q30 of the clean reads was about 93% and ensured the high quality of sequence data and subsequent analysis (Table 1). We identified 49,281 genes, of which 43,580 were known genes and 5701 were novel genes. Among the 47,212 new transcripts detected, 22,070 were long-chain non-coding RNA, 19,321 were new alternative splicing isoforms of known protein-coding genes, and 5821 were transcripts of new protein-coding genes. Next, we analyzed the correlation of sequenced samples and the distribution of gene expression (Fig. 3). Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis was performed to evaluate the similarity of the 12 cDNA databases. The three replications of each of the four groups (SC, PC, SD, and PD) clustered together and gene expression was strongly correlated within each group (Fig. 3A). The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the four groups were counted in Fig. 3B. At the torpedo-embryo stage, 17,363 DEGs between SC and PC were detected, of which 7363 genes were up-regulated and 10,000 genes was down-regulated. At the cotyledonary-embryo stage, 23,975 DEGs between SD and PD were identified, of which 10,177 genes were up-regulated and 13,798 genes were down-regulated (Fig. 3B). During the transition in embryo development from the torpedo- to the cotyledonary-embryo stages, 12,507 and 18,628 genes were differentially expressed in the silique walls and seeds, respectively, among which 4882/6809 genes were up regulated and 7625/11,819 genes were down regulated (Fig. 3B). A total of 2941 DEGs common to the four groups were identified (Fig. 3C). Analysis of differentially expressed genes during seed formationTo identify the function of the DEGs, functional classification was performed based on annotations in the Gene Ontology (GO) database (Fig. 4, Supplemental Fig. 1). In total, 24,854 genes were assigned to the biological process (BP), cellular component (CC), and molecular function (MF) categories, which were enriched in 15, 23, and 11 terms, respectively (Supplemental Fig. 1). In SC vs SD, SC vs PC, PC vs PD, and SD vs PD comparisons, the DEGs exhibited a similar GO classification. The three most highly enriched subcategories of BP for all four groups were biosynthetic process, cellular biosynthetic process, and organic substance biosynthetic process. The most highly enriched CC subcategories were integral component of membrane, intrinsic component of membrane, and membrane part. The MF terms showing the highest enrichment were DNA binding, kinase activity, and phosphotransferase activity. In the BP, CC, and MF categories, abundant genes were classified into transcription regulation related processes (Fig. 4). To explore the biological pathways in which the DEGs are involved, the Kyoto Gene and Genome Encyclopedia (KEGG) database was used for DEG classification. A total of 9637 DEGs were assigned to five branches with 19 subbranches (Supplemental Fig. 2). After enrichment analysis, the 10 top-ranked pathways with the highest gene numbers and a low Q value were screened and listed in Fig. 5. In PC vs PD, PC vs SC, SC vs SD, and PD vs SD comparisons, the pathway with the highest number of enriched DEGs was plant hormone signal transduction, followed by the MAPK signaling pathway. Expression pattern of GS biosynthesis and degradation associated genes during seed formationThe biosynthesis of GS involves three independent stages: elongation of aliphatic GS precursors, formation of the core structure and modification of side chains (Fig. 6A, Supplemental Table 2). Seventeen genes associated with elongation of aliphatic GS precursors were identified in the transcriptome of the seed and corresponding silique wall of Chinese kale. These genes consisted of two branched chain aminotransferase 4 (BCAT4), two bile acid transporter 5 (BAT5) genes, four methylthioalkyl malate synthase 1 (MAM1) genes, one methylsulfidealkenyl malate synthase 3 (MAM3), one isopropylmalate isomerase (IPMI), five isopropylmalate dehydrogenases (IPMDH) genes and two branched chain aminotransferase 3 (BCAT3) genes. At the torpedo- and cotyledonary-embryo stages, the expression of BCAT4-1, BAT5-1, MAM1-3, and MAM1-4 was lower in the seed than in the corresponding silique wall. In comparisons of the seed and silique wall, at the torpedo-embryo stage higher transcript levels for two BCAT4 genes, two BAT5s genes, MAM1-3, IPMI, IPMDH1-1, and BCAT3-2 were detected in the seed, whereas fewer transcripts of MAM1-1 and BCAT3-1 were detected in the silique wall at the cotyledonary-embryo stage (Fig. 6A).With regards to formation of the core structure, 12 genes comprising 39 members were mapped from the databases. These genes consisted of the cytochrome P450 homologs CYP79A2, CYP79B2, CYP79B3, CYP79F1, CYP83A1, and CYP83B1, carbon-sulfur lyase (SUR1), gamma-glutamyl polypeptide synthetase (GGP1), glucosyltransferase (UGT74B1), and desulfurized GS transferase genes SOT16, SOT17, and SOT18. In the synthesis of core structure of aliphatic GS, one CYP79F1, two CYP83A1, four SUR1, one GGP1, one UGT74B1, four SOT17, and eight SOT18 genes were identified. In the seed, the expression of CYP79F1, CYP83A1-1, CYP83A1-2, UGT74B1, SOT17-2, SOT17-4, SOT18-1, SOT18-4, and SOT18-5 was down regulated compared with that in the corresponding silique wall. Among genes with multiple members, such as SOT17 and SOT18, some members (SOT18-6 and SOT18-7) showed an increased expression level in the seed compared with that in the silique wall, whereas other members (SOT17-3 and SOT18-8) showed the opposite trend in SC vs PC and SD vs PD comparisons. In the comparison SD vs SC, the expression of CYP83A1-1, SOT18-4, SOT18-6, and SOT18-8 was higher in SD, whereas expression of CYP83A1-2 and SOT18-5 was lower in SD, compared with that in SC (Fig. 6A). For genes related to the synthesis of indolic and aromatic GS core structure, nine CYP79A2, three CYP79B2, one CYP79B3, one CYP83B1, and four SOT16 genes were identified. The expression of these genes is highlighted in Fig. 6A in blue and green, respectively.At the last step of secondary modification, six genes associated with aliphatic GS biosynthesis were identified including three monooxygenases (FMOGS) comprising one FMOGS-OX1, two FMOGS-OX5 genes, and three 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases (AOP2) genes. Similar to the afore mentioned expression patterns of multigene families, FMOGS gene members also showed differential expression patterns. The expression level of FMOGS-OX1 was decreased, whereas the expression of FMOGS-OX5-1 was increased in the comparison of PC vs SC and PD vs SD. The expression of FMOGS-OX5-2 was higher in PC, PD, and SC, whereas lower in SD (Fig. 6A). Genes involved in modification of indolic GS were also detected, including 14 CYP84F and five IGMT genes. The proteins encoded by these genes were predicted to be localized in mitochondria and their expression level varied in different samples (Fig. 6A).With regards to degradation of GS, six typical myrosinases (TGG1) were identified in the sequence database (Fig. 6B, Supplemental Table 2). The expression of TGG1 genes was relatively consistent in the developing seeds and silique walls. At the torpedo-embryo stage, transcript levels for TGG1-2, TGG1-3, and TGG1-6 genes were lower in SC compared with PC, whereas those of TGG1-1, TGG1-4, and TGG1-5 showed no obvious difference between SC and PC. At the early cotyledonary-embryo stage, abundant transcripts of TGG1 genes in the seed were detected and the expression of all TGG genes was significantly up regulated in the seed compared with the corresponding silique wall, and transcript levels were markedly higher than in the seed at the torpedo-embryo stages. Thus, it is proposed that during the transition of the embryo from the torpedo- to the early cotyledonary stage, myrosinases encoded by typical TGG1 genes accumulated massively in the seeds. With regards to specific degradation of indolic GS, expression of PEN2 was lower in the seed compared with the silique wall and remained stable with embryo development (Fig. 6B). Other beta-thioglucosidases that showed myrosinase activity were identified and the differential expression of these genes was also summarized in Fig. 6B.Five GTR genes including two GTR1 genes, one GTR2, and two GTR3 genes, were annotated in the transcriptome (Fig. 6C, Supplemental Table 3). Higher expression of GTR2 was detected in PC (vs SC) and PD (vs SD), which indicated that aliphatic GS may be transferred from the silique wall to the seed. Compared with the seed at the torpedo-embryo stage, GS transportation to the seed may be enhanced at the early cotyledonary-embryo stage because GTR2 transcript level was significantly enhanced in SD compared with that of SC. The transcript level of GTR1-2 was increased in PD (vs SD), but not in PC (vs SC). This difference may be related to the enhancement of GTR1-2 in the silique wall at the early cotyledonary-embryo stage as higher abundance of GTR1-2 transcripts was detected in PD than in PC. The gene GTR1-1 showed no obvious difference in transcript abundance among all four groups. The two GTR3 members showed opposite expression patterns. In SC vs PC and SD vs PD comparisons, expression of GTR3-1 was decreased, whereas expression of GTR3-2 was increased, respectively.Identification of transcriptional factors regulating GS biosynthesisPositive transcription regulators of the MYB family were annotated in the transcriptome (Fig. 6D, Supplemental Table 4). In Arabidopsis, MYB28, MYB29, and MYB76 are transcriptional factors regulating aliphatic GS biosynthesis, and MYB34, MYB122, and MYB51 are involved in the regulation of the synthesis of indolic GS. In the present study, with regards to regulation of aliphatic GS, four MYB28s, two MYB29s, and one MYB76 gene were identified. At the torpedo- and cotyledonary-embryo stages, expression of MYB28-1, MYB28-3, and MYB28-4 was down regulated, whereas MYB28-2 was up-regulated in the seed compared with the corresponding silique wall. Expression of MYB76 differed in all four groups. In SC vs PC at the torpedo-embryo stage, fewer MYB76 transcripts were detected in the seed. At the early cotyledonary-embryo stage, the MTB76 transcript level was significantly increased in the seed but decreased in the silique wall compared with those at the torpedo-embryo stage, and resulted in greater abundance of MYB76 transcripts in SD compared with that of PD. The expression of MYB29 was high in the silique wall at the cotyledonary-embryo stage and higher than that detected in the corresponding seed and in the silique wall at the torpedo-embryo stage. With respect to the regulation of indolic GS, the largest gene family was MYB34, which comprised 11 members. Besides, three MYB51 and three MYB122 genes were identified, of which the majority were more highly expressed in the silique wall than in the seed (Fig. 6D).To explore the regulation of GS metabolism, the possible interaction of GS metabolism-related genes was tested by means of protein-protein interaction assays. Only some transcription factor gene members were involved in protein-protein interaction (Fig. 7, Supplemental Table 4). Among 24 identified MYBs, six MYBs including MYB28-3, MYB29-1, MYB29-2, MYB34-4, MYB34-8, and MYB51-1 were predicted to regulate the synthetic protein. In the regulation of aliphatic GS, MYB28-3 showed close affinity for AOP2-3 and SOT18-5. Surprisingly, aliphatic GS-related MYB28-3 interacted with the indolic GS synthetic protein SOT16-4 and CYP83B1, which also could be regulated by MYB34, indicating a possible transcription factor-mediated crosstalk between indolic and aliphatic GSs.

Crops of the plant family Brassicaceae require more S compared with other crops for optimum growth and yield, with most S ultimately sequestered in the mature seeds as the storage proteins cruciferin and napin, along with the unique S-rich secondary metabolite glucosinolate (GSL). It is well established that S assimilation primarily takes place in the shoots rather than roots, and that sulphate is the major form in which S is transported and stored in plants. We carried out a developmental S audit to establish the net fluxes of S in two lines of Brassica juncea mustard where seed GSL content differed but resulted in no yield penalty.MethodsWe quantified S pools (sulphate, GSL and total S) in different organs at multiple growth stages until maturity, which also allowed us to test the hypothesis that leaf S, accumulated as a primary S sink, becomes remobilized as a secondary source to meet the requirements of GSL as the dominant seed S sink.Key ResultsMaximum plant sulphate accumulation had occurred by floral initiation in both lines, at which time most of the sulphate was found in the leaves, confirming its role as the primary S sink. Up to 52 % of total sulphate accumulated by the low-GSL plants was lost through senesced leaves. In contrast, S from senescing leaves of the high-GSL line was remobilized to other tissues, with GSL accumulating in the seed from commencement of silique filling until maturity.ConclusionWe have established that leaf S compounds that accumulated as primary S sinks at early developmental stages in condiment type B. juncea become remobilized as a secondary S source to meet the demand for GSL as the dominant seed S sink at maturity.", "intro": "INTRODUCTIONSulphur (S) is an essential macronutrient involved in numerous metabolic pathways required for plant growth, including the synthesis of amino acids, proteins, co-enzymes, vitamins and secondary metabolites such as glucosinolates (GSLs) and sulphoflavonoids. Plants take up S from the soil in the form of sulphate, which is then reduced to sulphide for further metabolism through S assimilation processes. In the S assimilation process, sulphate is activated to adenosine 5'-phosphosulphate (APS), which is the branching point for subsequent steps in which APS is reduced to form sulphide and 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulphate (PAPS). Sulphide is used for the synthesis of cysteine, which is the precursor for the synthesis of methionine and other primary metabolites, including storage proteins, whereas PAPS is used for sulphation of secondary metabolites, predominantly GSLs.Crops of the plant family Brassicaceae, such as canola (Brassica napus), mustard (Brassica juncea), Chinese cabbage (Brassica rapa) and other vegetables (Brassica oleracea), have a larger requirement for S to achieve optimum growth and yield compared with non-Brassicaceae crops. Most S is ultimately sequestered in the mature seeds of oleiferous brassicas as the storage proteins cruciferin and napin, along with GSLs. Glucosinolates have a wide range of unique properties affecting plant, animal and human health. Higher concentrations of GSLs are desired for providing the pungency to condiment mustard, while low concentrations have been selected for canola oil production.Physiological studies using the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae) have shown that S assimilation primarily takes place in the shoots rather than roots, and that sulphate is the major form in which S is transported and stored in plants. In this paper we refer to sources as those organs from which S and S-containing molecules are redistributed to sinks, and sinks as those organs with transient or ultimate storage of S or S-containing molecules (Fig. 1). Expression analysis of sulphate transporters identified in A. thaliana have confirmed their significant role in moving S between sources and sinks. The function of orthologues of these transporters also appears to be conserved to some extent in B. oleracea and B. napus.In recent years, the key processes responsible for S assimilation have been extensively studied, primarily in A. thaliana, and reviewed in terms of precursor molecules, primary and secondary products, associated enzymes and transport systems (reviwed in). Building on these findings, we developed a provisional model of the complex network of transporters, signalling molecules and transcription factors that regulate S metabolism within crop brassicas, including mustard. We consider soil as the primary source of S and roots and shoots both as primary and secondary S sources and sinks with overlapping functions (Fig. 1). Leaves play a dual role, first as a primary sink and later in development as a secondary source. The model predicts that targeting S assimilation in crop breeding within the context of source-sink relationships could result in modified levels of seed GSL or storage proteins. At present, this approach is hindered by the lack of comprehensive data describing the uptake, distribution and fate of S and S-containing metabolites throughout crop development. Addressing this gap in Brassica crops would allow a better understanding of the distinct S sources and sinks (Fig. 1), and thus guide optimized agronomic practice in terms of application of S fertilizer that may affect final seed composition. We have recently established that GSLs are a key secondary S sink in seeds of a high-GSL line of Indian mustard (B. juncea). The current study was therefore undertaken to determine whether the net fluxes of S in the crop plant B. juncea conform to the proposed model, based on evidence primarily from Arabidopsis.In order to understand the role of GSL as a potential secondary S sink we carried out a comprehensive S audit that quantified S pools (sulphate, GSL and total S) in organs of B. juncea at multiple growth stages until maturity, and quantified the content of GSL, sulphate and storage proteins in mature seeds. This allowed us to test the hypothesis that leaf S accumulated as a primary sink becomes remobilized as a secondary source to meet the requirements of GSL as the dominant seed S sink. The S audit was carried out in a line where 45 % of seed S is in GSL. This was compared with a line lacking GSL but where seed protein still represents a significant S sink, and where there is no yield penalty associated with lack of GSL.", "results": "RESULTSPhenology, biomass production and biomass partitioning between organsPhenology and growth patterns differed between the low- and the high-GSL line. The date of bolting was on average 20 d earlier for plants of the high-GSL line than for the low-GSL line. Although the high-GSL line had a shorter growth period prior to 50 % flowering (45 compared with 62 d after sowing), it accumulated more biomass by this stage (44.6 versus 27.8 g per plant) (Supplementary Data Tables S3 and S4). Whilst the high-GSL line attained peak biomass accumulation by 50 % flowering, in the low-GSL line biomass accumulation continued to increase until the silique filling stage (Fig. 2A, B; Supplementary Data Table S4).The mean seed yield of the low-GSL line was 3.3 g per plant with a harvest index (ratio of seed biomass to above-ground biomass) of 0.14, compared with 2.3 g per plant and a harvest index of 0.11 in the high-GSL line (Supplementary Data Table S3).Glucosinolate, sulphate and S accumulation during plant developmentThe accumulation of GSL in the low-GSL canola type line was negligible (<6.5 mg per plant) throughout the entire plant growth period (Fig. 2C; Supplementary Data Table S4) compared with the 162 mg of GSL per plant accumulated in the high-GSL condiment type line by maturity (Fig. 2C, D; Supplementary Data Table S4). Approximately half of the latter had been accumulated by floral initiation, predominately located in the leaves (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Data Tables S2a and S4). When rosette leaves started to abscise at flowering, cauline leaves and the reproductive organs of flower bud, flower and green silique contained >40 % of total GSLs in the high-GSL plants. However, by silique filling around half of the total plant GSL was located in the seeds, with the remainder in the stem, green silique and silique wall or pericarp. By maturity ~93 % of total plant GSL was located in seeds (Fig. 2D; Supplementary Data Table S3). Seed GSLs accounted for 7 % of the total seed mass of the high-GSL line, compared with 0.2 % of the seed mass in the low-GSL line (Fig. 3; Supplementary Data Tables S3 and S5). In the seeds of the low-GSL line protein accounted for 24 % of the seed mass, compared with 30 % in the high-GSL line (Fig. 3; Supplementary Data Tables S3 and S5).Plants of both the high- and low-GSL lines accumulated a maximum of ~890 mg of sulphate per plant (Fig. 2E, F; Supplementary Data Table S2). Maximum plant sulphate accumulation had occurred by floral initiation in both lines, at which time most of the sulphate was found in the leaves, which confirms their role as primary sink. Interestingly, up to 52.3 % of total sulphate accumulated by the low-GSL plants was lost through senesced leaves, which was not the case for the high-GSL line. Green seeds at the silique filling stage accounted for about half of the sulphate stored in mature seeds of both lines. At maturity, sulphate accounted for 1.4 % of the total seed mass of the high-GSL line, compared with 0.8 % in the low-GSL line (Fig. 3; Supplementary Data Table S3). By maturity, 6-8 % of total plant sulphate was located within the seed for both lines (Supplementary Data Table S3).The accumulation and partitioning of total plant S mirrored that of sulphate in both the high- and low-GSL lines (Fig. 2G, H; Supplementary Data Table S2). The low-GSL line had larger leaves and a longer vegetative phase, which increases the opportunity to accumulate more S (Fig. 2G; Supplementary Data Table S2). This was also reflected in increased biomass of the low-GSL line during the vegetative stage (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Data Table S4). Notably, while senesced leaves contained negligible amounts of GSL (below the detection limit of LC-MS), they contained around 50 and 36 % of total plant S at maturity in the low- and high-GSL lines, respectively (Fig. 2C, D, G, H; Supplementary Data Table S3). Total S accounted for 0.5 and 2.5 % of total seed mass at maturity for low- and high-GSL plants, respectively (Fig. 3; Supplementary Data Table S3).Distribution and forms of S over timeThe total S content of the high-GSL plants increased significantly from the early vegetative stage to flower initiation and then remained stable until maturity. The plants of the low-GSL line followed a similar trend, except that a small but significant (P < 0.05) decline in total S content was observed between flower initiation and maturity (Supplementary Data Table S4). At the whole-plant level there were significant differences in the distribution of sulphate-S between the high- and low-GSL lines. Sulphate was the major form of S in the early vegetative stage of the high-GSL line, and then decreased until maturity. In contrast, in the low-GSL line sulphate remained the predominant form of S throughout development (Supplementary Data Table S1). The proportion of total S localized in GSL (GSL-S) in the high-GSL line increased with the age of plants to a maximum of 13 % at maturity, whereas GSL-S was negligible (0.1-0.5 %) in the low-GSL line throughout development. At maturity, 45 % of total S in the seeds of the high-GSL line was GSL-S, compared with only 5 % of total S in the low-GSL line as GSL-S (Fig. 4; Supplementary Data Table S1).Theoretical mass balance calculation of the fate of S in the seed secondary sinkTo calculate the theoretical stoichiometric ratio of GSL-S and S in protein (protein-S) components contributing to seed mass (Table 1A), we used a GSL value of 100 micromol g-1 of seed mass as reported for mustard (B. juncea). Seed storage protein was estimated at 30 % of seed mass. The ratio of cruciferin to napin (1:0.3) was estimated from the available literature for Brassica species. This indicates that the proportion of total S stored in the seed as GSL-S is twice that of protein-S (Table 1A).Experimental evidence of the fate of S in mature seeds of low- and high-GSL linesMature seeds of the high GSL line contained 25 mg of S per gram of seeds (Fig. 5; Supplementary Data Table S5). This line accumulated 210 micromol of GSL per gram of seeds, of which 99.3 % was sinigrin (Supplementary Data Table S6). In contrast, seeds of the low-GSL line had 5 mg of total S and only 0.6 micromol of GSL per gram of seeds (Fig. 5; Supplementary Data Table S2). Sulphur stored in the seed protein (protein-S) of the high-GSL line was twice that of the low-GSL line (Table 1B; Fig. 5; Supplementary Data Table S5)."}, "31237979": {"doi": "10.1111/1750-3841.14680", "title": "Glucosinolate Content and Sensory Evaluation of Baby Leaf Rapeseed from Annual and Biennial White- and Yellow-Flowering Cultivars with Repeated Harvesting in Two Seasons", "abstract": "AbstractThe chemical and sensory quality of field-grown vegetables may be influenced by cultivar choice and agronomic factors but knowledge is lacking on the new rapeseed vegetables. White- and yellow-flowering rapeseed cultivars were tested in two seasonally different field studies in Denmark at three different growing stages by early sowing the first year and late sowing the second year. Content of glucosinolates (GLSs) was analyzed, and the sensory quality of baby leaf samples was evaluated. The GLS content differed among cultivars across years in all growing stages, with biennial cultivars having the highest GLS content. In the second year, a higher content of all identified GLSs was found at two growing stages except for neoglucobrassicin and gluconasturtiin, compared to the first year. On the contrary, higher contents of all identified GLSs were found at a third stage in the first year except for progoitrin and 4-methoxy glucobrassicin. Sensory evaluation of bitterness revealed differences among cultivars, higher intensities of bitterness in biennial cultivars, and a relationship between bitterness and content of bitter-tasting and total GLSs. The effect of repeated harvesting on GLS content differed between the years and no general pattern was seen, except that the composition of individual GLSs was comparable for the biennial cultivars. We conclude that growing season and life cycle had a stronger influence on GLS content than stage at harvest. The link between bitter-tasting GLSs and bitterness revealed that life cycle and seasonal effects affected the sensory profile of baby leaf rapeseed thereby making a healthier product due to high content of health-beneficial GLSs.", "intro": "IntroductionBaby leaves from white-flowering rapeseed (Brassica napus L. var. oleifera) are a relatively new crop in the Western world, as the trait white flower has only recently been reintroduced into modern cultivars of yellow-flowering cultivars of rapeseed (Groenbaek, Tybirk & Kristensen, 2018a). These new cultivars have proved suitable for baby leaf production. In rapeseed, annual (spring) or biennial (winter) cultivars are available for cultivation. In Northern Europe, annual cultivars are sown in spring and harvested in late summer, whereas biennial cultivars are sown in late summer/early autumn and harvested the following summer. Therefore, different cultivars possess different qualities with respect to the need for vernalization and winter hardiness, among other things. Based on practical experience, baby leaf salad of white-flowering rapeseed is thought to taste more mild and less bitter and astringent than baby leaf salad from yellow-flowering rapeseed.Over time, glucosinolates (GLSs) have been a major topic in rapeseed breeding and cultivation, as high levels of GLSs in the seeds can cause goitronic and other harmful effects in sensitive animals such as pigs, when the press cake is used as fodder (Bell, 1984). However, the negative effects have been markedly reduced due to low levels of GLSs in the seeds of modern cultivars. When rapeseed leaves are grown as a vegetable, the GLS-related challenges are less relevant, as the estimated daily intake of GLSs by humans is low compared to the press cake intake when used as protein fodder (Steinbrecher & Linseisen, 2009; Woyengo, Beltranena, & Zijlstra, 2017). Other well-known Brassicas grown as baby leaves are the kales B. oleracea var. sabellica/acephala and rape kale B. napus var. pabularia. Due to their content of GLSs and their breakdown products, the Brassica vegetables are thought to possess health-beneficial properties such as reduced risk of cancer development and cardiovascular disease mortality (Manchali, Chidambara Murthy, & Patil, 2012; Zhang et al., 2011). The GLS breakdown products isothiocyantes, nitriles, and thiocyanates are formed after tissue disruption and are initially a defense mechanism evolved in the plant to avoid herbivory (Textor & Gershenzon, 2009).In relation to optimizing GLS content for human health benefits, many studies have been made on the effect of plant age and developmental stage on GLS content. For example, an increase in the content of aliphatic GLSs was found in different kinds of kale throughout plant development (Groenbaek et al., 2016; Velasco, Cartea, Gonzalez, Vilar, & Ordas, 2007). Additionally, seasonal effects on GLS content due to different radiation and temperature levels have been exploited where effects of temperature, photosynthetic photon flux, and day length depended on the type and cultivar of different B. oleracea (Charron, Saxton, & Sams, 2005). The possibilities of repeated harvesting are of interest with regard to reducing the use of resources for vegetable growing in a more sustainable way (Kristensen & Stavridou, 2017). Even though repeated harvesting is common practice, at least in baby leaf rocket production, only few studies have been conducted (Hall, Jobling, & Rogers, 2015). Hall et al. (2015) found that the content of total GLSs decreased in a second harvest, as 4-hydroxy glucobrassicin was not detected in the perennial wall rocket (Diplotaxis tenuifolia L. DC.) and glucobrassicin and 4-methoxy glucobrassicin were absent in the second harvest of the annual garden rocket (Eruca sativa Mill.). They were all detected in the first harvest. Another study found only increasing content of primarily aliphatic GLSs in the same species due to several repeated harvests, arguing that due to the stress imposed on the plants, an elevated level of the defense compounds, in this case GLSs, was observed (Nitz & Schnitzler, 2002).Some of the GLSs and their breakdown products may also have an effect on the sensory profile of baby leaf rapeseed, because they contribute to a bitter taste and high intensity of pungency in other vegetables. These GLSs include mainly sinigrin (2-propenyl GLS), gluconapin (3-butenyl GLS), progoitrin (2-hydroxy-3-butenyl), glucobrassicin (3-indolylmethyl), and neoglucobrassicin (1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl; Drewnowski & Gomez-Carneros, 2000; Engel, Baty, le Corre, Souchon, & Martin, 2002; Mithen, Dekker, Verkerk, Rabot, & Johnson, 2000; Molmann et al., 2015; Pasini, Verardo, Cerretani, Caboni, & D'Antuono, 2011; Schonhof, Krumbein, & Bruckner, 2004; van Doorn et al., 1998). However, so far no sensory evaluation of rapeseed baby leaves has been reported. Bitterness and pungency has previously been linked to reduced consumer acceptance (Drewnowski & Gomez-Carneros, 2000), thereby introducing a dilemma between the positive health aspect of GLSs and the dislike of bitterness.The objectives of the study were to investigate if cultivar selection of white and yellow-flowering rapeseed cultivars, including qualities ascribed to annual and biennial cultivars, influenced the GLS content and composition as well as the sensory profile in baby leaf salad across two years. Furthermore, the objective was to test the effects of repeated harvesting and intact plants (grown unharvested for the same period) on GLS content and composition in a field experiment. The study was conducted with shifted sowing and harvesting dates in two consecutive years in order to address the influence of seasonal variation and rate of development on the phytochemicals and sensory properties.", "results": "Results and DiscussionEffect of growing stage on glucosinolate content and compositionThe following GLSs were identified from baby leaves in all stages: the aliphatic GLSs progoitrin ((R)-2-hydroxy-3-butenyl GLS), glucobrassicanapin (4-pentenyl GLS), and glucoraphanin (4-methylsulphinylbutyl GLS). Glucobrassicanapin and glucoraphanin were only identified in 2017 and glucoraphanin only in traces, for which reason no data is presented. The indole GLSs glucobrassicin (3-indolymethyl GLS), 4-hydroxy glucobrassicin (4-hydroxy-3-indolylmethyl GLS), 4-methoxy glucobrassicin (4-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl GLS), and neoglucobrassicin (1-methoxy-3-indolylmethyl GLS), and the aromatic gluconasturtiin (2-phenylethyl GLS). Bitter-tasting GLSs is the sum of progoitrin, glucobrassicin, and neoglucobrassicin. Total GLSs is the sum of all identified GLSs.The effects of growing stage on the identified GLSs differed, and an interaction between cultivar and growing stage was found for all identified GLSs except for 4-methoxy glucobrassicin and gluconasturtiin (data not shown) in 2016 and 4-hydroxy glucobrassicin in 2017 (Figure 2). The plants harvested at stage IIcut had the highest content of progoitrin for all the biennial cultivars (\"Jadak,\" \"Witt,\" \"Lilput,\" and \"Labrador\") in 2017, whereas differences between growing stages were only seen for \"Fenja\" in 2016. For the indole GLS group, effects of growing stage differed between the years, as stage IIcut contained the highest levels of glucobrassicin, neoglucobrassicin, and 4-hydroxy glucobrassicin for the annual cultivars (\"Lyside\" and \"Fenja\") in 2016. In 2016, the content of total GLSs was higher at stage IIcut than at stage I, which was again higher than stage IIuncut when evaluated as mean values of cultivars (Figure 3). In 2017, the picture was quite different, and for most cultivars stage I plants had a higher content of total GLSs than the other two growing stages, or at least one of them.In a study on the Portuguese Couve-nabica (B. napus), the content of total GLSs increased from sowing till 8 weeks after sowing, corresponding to stage IIuncut in this study (harvested approximately 6 and 9 weeks after sowing; Rosa, Heaney, Portas, & Fenwick, 1996) The results of the study by Rosa et al. (1996) differed from our results, though. However, looking only at the indole GLS contents of the Couve-nabica, a decrease was found in the same period. This result is comparable to our findings, as the content of the most abundant indole GLSs, glucobrassicins, and 4-methoxy glucobrassicin at stage IIuncut was lower than at stages I and IIcut. Furthermore, a negative linear relationship between glucobrassicin (P < 0.0001, r 2 = 0.28) and 4-methoxy glucobrassicin (P = 0.0002, r 2 = 0.16) and the BBCH scale code was found. In general, the share of indole GLSs compared to aliphatic GLSs was very high in the tested rapeseed cultivars compared to other Brassicas (Bhandari, Jo, & Lee, 2015; Hall et al., 2015), and in accordance with the Couve-nabica (Rosa et al., 1996) and the winter and spring rapeseed cultivars tested by Sarwar and Kirkegaard (1998). This trend was confirmed in sprouts and seedlings of the tested cultivars from this study and could very well be a result of the double low rapeseed characteristics, which both the tested cultivars and canola possess (Groenbaek, Tybirk, & Kristensen, 2018b). The responses in GLS content to the different growing stages were not the same in 2016 and 2017. In 2016, the annual cultivars were developing toward flowering (intact plants/stage IIuncut), whereas the biennial cultivars only faced vernalization in 2017. This could cause different responses in the GLS biosynthesis, as developmental stage has previously been found to alter GLS content and composition in rapeseed (Clossais-Besnard & Larher, 1991) and hence affect the sensory properties. However, as only the annual cultivars in 2016 underwent the transition from vegetative stage to flowering stage, the growing conditions differing due to seasonal variation between the years must have been the main driver for differences in GLS content and composition. The divergent responses among the annual cultivars with respect to progoitrin and neoglucobrassicin content (Figures 2a, b, and i) could be explained by their difference in genetic origin, as \"Lyside,\" \"Silvershadow,\" and \"Fenja\" are not closely related except for the white flower character in \"Lyside\" and \"Silvershadow,\" which originated from the cultivar \"Hobson.\" In contrast, the biennial cultivars were rather closely related, as they contained at least 62% similar genes due to backcrossing to \"Labrador.\" The flower color of \"Jadak,\" \"Witt,\" and \"Lilput\" originates from the rapeseed cultivar \"Bianca\" (Tybirk, personal communication).The effect of repeated harvesting on the GLS content of baby leaf salad has only been investigated to a limited degree (Hall et al., 2015; Nitz & Schnitzler, 2002). White-flowering rapeseed is a new salad crop, and only one study of growth and phytochemical content in the context of baby leaf production have been published to date (Groenbaek et al., 2019). Although we found differing effects of repeated harvesting, Hall et al. (2015) consequently experienced a reduced content of total GLSs in the second harvest independently of the species and season in perennial wall rocket and annual garden rocket. This was mainly due to the lack of identification of the indole GLSs in the second harvest, which led to the decrease.An increase of GLSs at stage IIcut could be expected, as it mimics an abiotic stress such as herbivory or grazing (Textor & Gershenzon, 2009). This theory was supported by the 2016 results, but not by the results from 2017. This could be explained by relatively high average temperatures (18.0  C in 2016 and 12.1  C in 2017), less precipitation (13.2 mm in 2016 and 87.3 mm in 2017), and higher average daily radiation (411 micromol/m2/s in 2016 and 146 in micromol/m2/s 2017) in 2016, compared to 2017, during the period from the harvest at stage I till harvest of stage II (Figure 1). This may have led to conditions of induced stress, resulting in a higher content of GLSs adding to the stress of cutting. In general, higher temperatures have been linked to increased GLS content (Neugart et al., 2018). For the indole GLSs, this could be due to a temperature effect on the indole-3-acetic pathway, where higher temperatures favor an indole-3-acetic biosynthesis without tryptophan, leading to a higher pool of tryptophan available for indole GLS biosynthesis, as argued by Charron et al. (2005). As glucobrassicin is the precursor of 4-methoxy glucobrassicin, 4-hydroxy glucobrassicin, and neoglucobrassicin, the elevated temperatures in 2016 compared to 2017 might also have inhibited methoxylation, which Zhang et al. (2008) suggested was the case for turnip root (B. rapa ssp. rapifera L.). Indeed, a share of 80% of glucobrassicin of the total GLS content at stage IIcut from 2016 indicates an accumulation.Effect of cultivar, life cycle, and year on glucosinolate content and compositionAcross years, cultivar effects were found in four out of seven GLSs, the total indole GLSs and total GLSs at stage I (Table 1). An effect of life cycle was found for all individual GLSs and the total content of GLSs, where the biennial cultivars in general had a higher content of GLSs than the annual cultivars. In contrast, in a previous study the annual cultivar \"Silvershadow\" had a higher content of all identified indole GLSs as well as total GLSs than biennial cultivars, when the same cultivars were grown as sprouts and seedlings (Groenbaek et al., 2018a).At stage I, differences in total GLS content between the 2 years were quite distinct and were evaluated to be 57% higher for the annual cultivars and 48% higher for the biennial in 2017 compared to 2016. This difference was mainly due to elevated levels of glucobrassicin and 4-methoxy glucobrassicin in 2017 compared to 2016, whereas the content of neoglucobrassicin was higher in 2016.The differences between years in terms of GLS content could be due to a relationship between plant yield and the fact that a dilution effect can occur, as the plants grow bigger (Groenbaek & Kristensen, 2014). In our case, the yield was approximately twice as high in 2016 compared to 2017 (Groenbaek et al., 2019). This was supported by a negative linear relationship at stage I between yield and total GLS content with both years included (P = 0.0009, r 2 = 0.26). In addition, a negative linear relationship between total GLSs and BBCH scale code (data not shown) for stages I and IIuncut was found (P < 0.0001, r 2 = 0.24), supporting this theory. Furthermore, a higher level of S in the soil in 2017 could also have contributed to elevated GLS levels, as described by Groenbaek et al. (2014) in a study on field-grown curly kale.Cultivar and life cycle effects were also found at stage IIuncut and stage IIcut, but to a lesser extent than at stage I (Table 2 and 3). Life cycle effects were due to a generally higher content of GLSs in the biennial cultivars, compared to the annual ones, as found at stage I. An effect of year occurred frequently at stages IIuncut and IIcut, but different GLSs were affected when compared to stage I. The content of all identified GLSs, except for neoglucobrassicin, was higher in 2017 than in 2016 at stage IIuncut, whereas only progoitrin and 4-methoxy glucobrassicin were found in higher contents in 2017 than in 2016 at stage IIcut. Furthermore, interactions between year and life cycle occurred at stage IIcut, which could be explained by the lacking data from \"Silvershadow\" in 2016 and \"Lyside\" in 2017, as the mean GLS content of the annual cultivars then was either higher (in 2016) or lower (in 2017) than it probably would have been, if the data had been present.A higher content of GLSs in biennial (winter rapeseed) compared to annual (spring rapeseed) cultivars, as seen in our study, was also found in a previous field study, where both types were grown in spring (Sarwar & Kirkegaard, 1998). Thus, Sarwar and Kirkegaard (1998) also found that the content of GLSs decreased as the plants grew bigger and came nearer to flowering, supporting our results with respect to dilution and effects of ontogeny, where flowering has been found to reduce the content of GLSs in rapeseed (Clossais-Besnard & Larher, 1991). Furthermore, the biennial cultivars did not approach formation of buds due to lack of vernalization, which could explain the elevated GLS content compared to the annual cultivars in both years, because the biennial cultivars were kept at their vegetative stage, as argued by Sarwar and Kirkegaard (1998). Although no visible signs of bud formation were seen in the annual cultivars in 2017.The content of bitter-tasting GLSs (progoitrin, glucobrassicin, and neoglucobrassicin) at stage I differed among cultivars and years with \"Silvershadow\" containing the lowest amount of bitter-tasting GLSs in both years (Table 1). In 2016, \"Witt\" had the highest content in contrast to \"Jadak\" in 2017. The content of bitter-tasting GLSs was higher in 2017 compared to 2016 following the trend of glucobrassicin, which was the dominant bitter-tasting GLS. Based on practical experience, the baby leaf salad of the white-flowering rapeseed is thought to taste more mild and less bitter and astringent than baby leaf salad from the yellow-flowering rapeseed. These differences might be linked to the content of the mentioned GLSs and their breakdown products (Molmann et al., 2015; Pasini et al., 2011). However, we found no effects of flower color on bitter-tasting GLS contents and GLS content in general (Table 1 to 3), which confirmed the results for seedlings of the same cultivars (Groenbaek et al., 2018b).Effect of cultivar, life cycle, and year on sensory profileThe results of the sensory evaluations in 2016 and 2017 are shown in Table 4. The results of the 2 years are not directly comparable, as the composition of the sensory panel and the cultivars evaluated differed between the 2 years. \"Lyside\" was included in the evaluation in 2016, but not in 2017. As seen in Table 4, four of the evaluated sensory attributes were significantly different between the cultivars in 2016, whereas only bitterness differed between the cultivars in 2017. \"Silvershadow\" and \"Lilput\" had the lowest intensity of bitterness in 2017, whereas \"Silvershadow\" had the lowest intensity of bitterness in 2016, although the level was not significant. In 2016, the intensity of flower vase water aroma was higher for the annual cultivars compared with the biennial cultivars (Table 4). In contrast, biennial cultivars had a higher intensity of rapeseed aroma and bitterness. The same result for bitterness was found in 2017, whereas flower vase water aroma intensity was higher for the biennial cultivars. Moreover, fresh green aroma was found in higher intensities in the biennial cultivars compared with the annual cultivars. There were no differences in any of the sensory attributes when the group of white-flowering rapeseed was compared with yellow-flowering rapeseed (data not shown). The reason why bitterness only differed between the cultivars in 2017 could be that \"Lyside\" was excluded from the sensory analysis in 2017 or that the content of GLSs was generally higher in 2017 than in 2016.The relation between sensory profile and content of glucosinolateThe sensory profile was found to be affected by the GLS content, as shown by the PCA biplots for the 2 years (2016 and 2017; Figure 4). Besides the individual GLSs, which were found to differ between cultivars or life cycle, the total content of the potential bitter-tasting GLSs has been included along with the total content of indole and all GLSs.As seen in Figure 4, the difference between life cycles for both years (PC1 66% and 51% for 2016 and 2017, respectively) had the greatest effect on the variation. The biennial cultivars were characterized by a high intensity of bitterness and astringency as well as a high content of individual bitter-tasting GLSs and a total content of bitter-tasting GLSs. The cultivars seemed to react differently the 2 years. Bitterness varied significantly in 2017, and the bitterness was highly related to both the content of bitter-tasting GLSs as well as to total GLSs (Figure 4b). The same relationship between bitterness and content of bitter-tasting GLSs and total GLSs is shown in Figure 4a, even though bitterness did not contribute to the variation, as it was not significant. The analysis confirms that the three individual GLSs included in the calculation of the content of bitter GLSs are the most bitter-tasting GLSs as stated in previous studies (Drewnowski & Gomez-Carneros, 2000; Engel et al., 2002; Mithen et al., 2000; Molmann et al., 2015; Pasini et al., 2011; Schonhof et al., 2004; van Doorn et al., 1998). However, progoitrin seemed to show a weaker relationship with bitterness in 2016 (Figure 4a), just as 4-hydroxy glucobrassicin and glucobrassicanapin (in 2017) may also have contributed to the bitterness.The identification of bitter-tasting GLSs from the above-mentioned studies relies on a broad spectrum of experimental setups, including different species and processing methods. Previous studies have mainly revealed the relationship between bitterness and the aliphatic GLSs progoitrin, sinigrin, and glucosativin (Drewnowski & Gomez-Carneros, 2000; Engel et al., 2002; Mithen et al., 2000; Pasini et al., 2011; Schonhof et al., 2004; van Doorn et al., 1998), whereas the results of the present study show that glucobrassicin was the main GLS contributor to the bitterness in the group of bitter-tasting GLSs followed by progoitrin and neoglucobrassicin (Figure 4b). However, since the GLS profiles of the different vegetables differ, the results are not directly comparable. Our finding that these three GLSs were the major contributors to bitterness in baby leaf rapeseed consolidated the rather weak relationships found by Molmann et al. (2015) and Engel et al. (2002).Bell, Methven, Signore, Oruna-Concha, and Wagstaff (2017) indicated that GLSs found only in low levels in a limited number of cultivars might result in distinct flavors of these specific cultivars. They found this for 4-hydroxy glucobrassicin and glycoalyssin and their correlation with bitter aftereffects, pepper flavor, and mustard flavor and aftereffects amongst others. In the present study, glycoalyssin was not identified, and no differences in the content of 4-hydroxy glucobrassicin were found among cultivars, which limits the support of our findings to the above-mentioned. However, a higher content of 4-hydroxy glucobrassicin found in the biennial cultivars and the relationship between 4-hydroxy glucobrassicin and bitterness given from the PCA biplots indicated a contribution to the higher intensities of bitterness, although glucobrassicin was the main contributor among the indole GLSs (Table 1). Moreover, as glucobrassicanapin varied among cultivars and life cycles and showed a high relationship with bitterness in 2017, this GLS might contribute to bitter taste (Figure 4b)."}, "19489111": {"doi": "10.1631/jzus.B0820354"}, "23873294": {"doi": "10.3390/ijms140714996", "title": "Induced Production of 1-Methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl Glucosinolate by Jasmonic Acid and Methyl Jasmonate in Sprouts and Leaves of Pak Choi (Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis)", "abstract": "Pak choi plants (Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis) were treated with different signaling molecules methyl jasmonate, jasmonic acid, linolenic acid, and methyl salicylate and were analyzed for specific changes in their glucosinolate profile.

Furthermore, the effects of the different signaling molecules on indole glucosinolate accumulation were analyzed on the level of gene expression using semi-quantitative realtime RT-PCR of selected genes. The treatments with signaling molecules were performed on sprouts and mature leaves to determine ontogenetic differences in glucosinolate accumulation and related gene expression. The highest increase of indole glucosinolate levels, with considerable enhancement of the 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate content, was achieved with treatments of sprouts and mature leaves with methyl jasmonate and jasmonic acid. This increase was accompanied by increased expression of genes putatively involved in the indole glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway. The high levels of indole glucosinolates enabled the plant to preferentially produce the respective breakdown products after tissue damage. Thus, pak choi plants treated with methyl jasmonate or jasmonic acid, are a valuable tool to analyze the specific protection functions of 1-methoxy-indole-3-carbinole in the plants defense strategy in the future.", "intro": "1. IntroductionPlants are sessile and therefore had to develop different strategies against multiple environmental impacts such as abiotic and biotic stressors. A very effective strategy against unwanted biotic effectors such as pathogens or herbivores is the accumulation of defense compounds. The induction or increased synthesis of such compounds is mediated by signaling molecules, for instance jasmonic acid (JA), ethylene, and salicylic acid (SA), which activate corresponding transduction pathways. Necrotrophic pathogens and herbivorous insects are commonly deterred by jasmonate-dependent defenses, while pathogens with a biotrophic lifestyle are more sensitive to a salicylate-dependent response (Figure 1).Glucosinolates are characteristic secondary metabolites of the order Brassicales and can be regarded as defense compounds. Glucosinolates are beta-d-thioglucoside-N-hydroxysulfates linked with a variable side chain, which is derived from different amino acid precursors. More than 120 glucosinolates are known, and depending on the chemical structure of the precursor amino acid they are classified into three groups: aliphatic, indole and aromatic glucosinolates. The glucosinolate profile itself and modifications thereof, together with specific hydrolyzation products, are being discussed as a defense mechanism of plants to cope with various abiotic and biotic stresses.Since the discovery that a degradation product of 4-methylsulfinylbutyl glucosinolate is a strong inducer of phase II detoxification enzymes in mammals thus protecting against the risk of cancer, research in the last two decades has been mainly focused on the elucidation of aliphatic glucosinolates biosynthesis and their corresponding breakdown products. Less attention has been paid to biosynthesis of indole glucosinolates, although these glucosinolates are induced by insect or pathogen attacks and also influence the oviposition of crucifer specialist insects. Indole glucosinolates were most prominent in roots and also found in leaves, therefore Brassicaceae providing breakdown products of glucosinolates are a good source for plant based manure and biofumigation, respectively. Additionally, recent studies have shown that indole glucosinolates, especially breakdown products of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate, exert mutagenic or genotoxic effects in mammalian and bacterial cell studies. Thus, Brassica species with high indole glucosinolate concentrations could act specifically as a deterrent or toxin against insects or soilborn pathogens.Biosynthesis of indole glucosinolates starts with conversion of the precursor amino acid tryptophan to the corresponding aldoxime by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase CYP79B2 or CYP79B3 (Figure 2). The aldoxime enters the glucosinolate core biosynthesis to form the indol-3-methyl-desulfoglucosinolate and is finally sulfated by the sulfotransferase SOT16 to form the proper glucosinolate. Modification of the built indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate by members of the cytochrome P450 family CYP81F leads to formation of hydroxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolates that could be methylated to methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolates by a specific class of plant family 2-O-methyltransferases.Most of the knowledge about effects of signaling molecules on glucosinolates biosynthesis is known from studies with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. However, elicitation studies with signaling molecules, such as linolenic acid, methyl jasmonate, jasmonic acid and salicylic acid have also shown an enhancement of glucosinolates levels in several Brassica species. It is known from Arabidopsis thaliana that methyl jasmonate induces the transcription factors ATR1/MYB34 and HIG1/MYB51 subsequently altering the expression levels of CYP79B2 and CYP79B3 and the SOT16 finally resulting in enhanced indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate levels. In contrast it is known that salicylic acid or related compounds can inhibit the transcriptional activation induced by jasmonate. Furthermore, application of salicylic acid to A. thaliana led to induction of mainly aliphatic glucosinolates, and specifically to the accumulation of 4-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate. A current survey revealed that the constitutive level of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate is reasonably high in the species pak choi (Brassica rapa ssp. chinensis) when compared to other Brassicales. Moreover this high level is specified by genotypic variation and ontogenetically modified in sprouts and leaves.Since the B. rapa genome was recently identified we chose pak choi as most revelatory Brassica model plant to analyze the signaling and metabolic pathway of indole glucosinolates, particularly of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate.To investigate the specific function of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate within the plant-environment interaction in more detail, our aims were (1) to assess whether signaling molecules specifically affect 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate biosynthesis and if so (2) to evaluate ontogenetic differences in the induction of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolates (3) to determine the impact of these signaling molecules on the expression of key genes of the indole glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway and corresponding transcriptional regulators, and finally (4) to rate the expected profile of indole glucosinolate degradation products upon tissue rupture for assessing the respective breakdown products.", "results": "2. Results and DiscussionThe influence of different signaling molecules on indole glucosinolate biosynthesis has been analyzed in the leafy Brassica vegetable pak choi in conjunction with gene expression studies of the core biosynthetic pathway (CYP79B2/B3, SOT16) and corresponding transcriptional regulators (MYB34, MYB51, MYB122), as well as genes putative involved in secondary modification of indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolates (CYP81F family, O-methyltransferases).Initially, a total of seven individual glucosinolates were determined in the pak choi cultivar Joi Choi. The group of aliphatic glucosinolate contained the alkenyl glucosinolates 3-butenyl, 4-pentenyl and one hydroxyalkenyl glucosinolate, 2-hydroxy-3-butenyl. The group of indole glucosinolates comprised the four indole glucosinolates indol-3-ylmethyl, 4-hydroxy-indol-3-ylmethyl, 4-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl, and 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate. While in pak choi sprouts all these mentioned glucosinolates were detectable, in mature leaves 2-hydroxy-3-butenyl and 4-hydroxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate were below the detection limit.2.1. Indole Glucosinolates Are Induced in Pak Choi Sprouts Treated with Signaling MoleculesThe total glucosinolate level of untreated sprouts was 42.4 mumol g-1 dw with aliphatic glucosinolates describing 98% of the total glucosinolate level and only 2% were total indole glucosinolates. Depending on elicitor treatment the glucosinolate levels showed either no change or increased up to 56.1 mumol g-1 dw (Figure 3A), while plantlets were visibly not affected by any of the treatments. However, only methyl jasmonate and jasmonate treatment lead to a significant increase of indole glucosinolates (Figure 3A), whereas the aliphatic glucosinolates were less affected. The total indole glucosinolate level increased from 0.8 mumol g-1 dw prior to elicitor treatment to the highest amount of 5.2 mumol g-1 dw following methyl jasmonate treatment. Compared to control this equates up to an 8.5-fold enhancement of indole glucosinolates.In addition, individual indole glucosinolates respond differently to the elicitor treatment in sprouts (Figure 4A). While 4-hydroxy-indol-3-ylmethyl and 4-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate remained almost unaffected with all different treatments, the application of specific elicitors had strong effects on indol-3-ylmethyl and 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate levels. Methyl jasmonate, jasmonate, and also linolenic acid induced indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate about 5-fold while linolenic acid led to a 2-fold increase, respectively. The strongest induction of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate levels in sprouts of about 31-fold and 38-fold was detected after treatment with methyl jasmonate and jasmonate (Figure 4A).These results are in agreement with other studies, reporting an enhancement of indole glucosinolates in A. thaliana and other Brassicaceae treated with signaling molecules. Depending on the Brassica species the increase of total indole glucosinolate level after methyl jasmonate or jasmonic acid treatment was always based on an induction of indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate or its 1-methoxy modification product.The induction of indole glucosinolate biosynthesis metabolism was further analyzed with expression studies of selected genes involved in this pathway and its regulation. As previously indicated more than one orthologue to genes of A. thaliana could be expected in the Brassica rapa genome. Nucleotide sequences of coding regions of the genes of interest were identified on respective BAC clones of Brassica rapa cultivar Chiifu and were used for the development of isoform specific oligonucleotide primer pairs (Table 1). The genes of interest were the transcriptional regulators of indole glucosinolate biosynthesis MYB34, MYB51 and MYB122, the key genes of indole glucosinolate core biosynthesis, CYP79B2/B3 and SOT16, and genes putatively involved in of side chain modification of indole-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate of the CYP81F gene family and selected members of the gene family of O-methyltransferases. Semi-quantitative real time RT-PCR was performed on RNA isolated from pak choi sprouts treated with methyl jasmonate, jasmonic acid, linolenic acid, and methyl salicylate, and were compared to respective control treatments. Specific amplification products were detectable with all chosen oligonucleotide primer combinations.It is already known from experiments with A. thaliana that AtMYB34 and AtMYB51 are transcriptionally induced by methyl jasmonate. Our results in pak choi sprouts are consistent with these findings. In detail, methyl jasmonate and jasmonate led to strong increases of BrMYB34 depending on the isoform, and also the tested isoforms of BrMYB51 are upregulated under these conditions (Figure 5). The treatments with linolenic acid and methyl salicylate also enhanced the expression of specific isoforms of BrMYB34 and BrMYB51 on pak choi sprouts, however, the increase was less pronounced. In addition, all elicitor treatments resulted in an induced expression of both isoforms of BrMYB122 when compared to control sprouts (Figure 5).In A. thaliana enhanced accumulation of indole glucosinolates is further accompanied by a jasmonate-dependent increase in expression of genes of the core biosynthetic pathway as well as genes involved in tryptophan biosynthesis. Similar effects of methyl jasmonate and jasmonate were found on transcriptional level for genes of the core biosynthetic pathway in pak choi sprouts (Figure 6). However, it is not possible to separate the direct effect of the chemical elicitor on the transcription of these genes from the influence caused by the various transcription factors since there are no respective mutants of pak choi available. Nevertheless, the expression of BrCYP79B2/B3 isoforms and BrSOT16 were strongly increased upon methyl jasmonate and jasmonate treatment, while linolenic acid and methyl salicylate led to only weak induction of BrSOT16 and BrCYP79B2 isoforms. The selected genes putatively involved in side chain modification of indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate showed also most expression differences with methyl jasmonate and jasmonate treatment when compared to the control.Remarkably, in control sprouts the main indole glucosinolate is 4-methoxy-indol-3ylmethyl glucosinolate, followed by indol-3-ylmethyl and 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate (Figure 7A). As previously mentioned an increase of total indole glucosinolate levels was only found after treatment with methyl jasmonate or jasmonic acid and this was always based on an induction of indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate and its 1-methoxy modification product. Thus, with methyl jasmonate and jasmonate treatment the modification pattern of indol-3ylmethyl glucosinolate switched to 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate with a strong relative loss of 4-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate (Figure 7A). This finding supports the assumption that enzyme activity responsible for conversion of indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate to 4-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate or 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate might be specifically induced by signaling molecules. Furthermore, experiments in A. thaliana have shown that methoxylation of indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate to 4-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate is suppressed by methyl jasmonate. However, none of the selected genes putatively involved in side chain modification of indole glucosinolate is following such an expression pattern in pak choi sprouts.2.2. Ontogenetic Differences in Induction of Indole Glucosinolates in Pak ChoiA previous survey of different pak choi cultivars revealed genotypic but also ontogenetic differences in the glucosinolate profile. Therefore the same signaling molecules were also applied to mature leaves of pak choi plants and their effects on the glucosinolate levels together with the corresponding gene expression has been analyzed. The total glucosinolate level of untreated leaves was 0.5 mumol g-1 dw with aliphatic glucosinolates describing 86% of the total glucosinolate level and 14% were total indole glucosinolates. Depending on elicitor treatment the glucosinolate levels showed either no change or increased up to 3.1 mumol g-1 dw (Figure 3B), while leaves and whole plants were visibly not affected by any of the treatments in the timeframe investigated. Methyl jasmonate and jasmonate treatment lead to a significant increase of glucosinolates (Figure 3B), whereas in contrast to sprouts both the aliphatic and indole glucosinolates were affected. The total aliphatic glucosinolate levels increased from 0.4 mumol g-1 dw prior to elicitor treatment to the highest amount of 1.7 mumol g-1 dw following methyl jasmonate treatment, while the total indole glucosinolate level increased from 0.1 mumol g-1 dw to the highest amount of 1.7 mumol g-1 dw following jasmonic acid treatment. Compared to control this equates up to a 25-fold enhancement of indole glucosinolates. As in sprouts the strongest induction in leaves was detected in 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate levels after treatment with methyl jasmonate and jasmonate (Figure 4B). Although these results are in agreement with studies reporting an enhancement of indole glucosinolates in other Brassicaceae treated with signaling molecules the increases shown in our experiments are much higher than the data reported for example from Brassica rapa, A. thaliana and Brassica napus.The induction of indole glucosinolate biosynthesis metabolism in leaves was further analyzed with expression studies of the selected genes involved in this pathway in A. thaliana and its regulation. In contrast to our previous experiments with pak choi sprouts (Figure 5) the results in pak choi leaves did not show consistent and strong increases of BrMYB34 and BrMYB51 isoform expression 48 h after elicitor application (Figure 5). Only in the treatment with jasmonic acid an increased expression of BrMYB34_3 and BrMYB122_1 was found 48 h after application, while linolenic acid and methyl salicylate still enhanced the expression of BrMYB122_2. The absence of induced expression of the respective transcriptional regulators, the responsive elements that initiate transcriptional answers on external stimuli, could be due to the sampling of plant material with 48 hours adaptation time following elicitor treatment. While this timeframe is necessary to see maximum changes in the glucosinolate profile of sprouts, it might be too late to analyze induction of transcription factors involved. Harvesting of leaves at earlier time points after elicitor application would be needed for confirmation; however it is not the primary focus of this study. Additionally, the transcriptional level of genes of the core biosynthetic pathway was analyzed and induced expression of BrCYP79B2/B3 isoforms and BrSOT16 was still detectable 48 hours after jasmonate application (Figure 6). This is in good agreement with the finding that jasmonate treatment causes the strongest induction of indole glucosinolates (Figure 4B). More specific as in sprouts only one of the selected genes putatively involved in side chain modification of the CYP81F gene family and of O-methyltransferases showed significant expression differences with methyl jasmonate and jasmonate treatment when compared to the control.When compared to sprouts treatment with methyl jasmonate or jasmonic acid strongly induces indole glucosinolate biosynthesis also in pak choi leaves. This induction is accompanied by an extraordinary enhancement of its 1-methoxy indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate (Figure 7B). Although there are numerous reports showing an enhancement of indole glucosinolates in Brassicaceae treated with signaling molecules the increase of 1-methoxy indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate shown in our experiments are much higher.2.3. High Levels of Particular Indole Glucosinolate Breakdown Products after Tissue Disruption of Pak Choi LeavesIt is reported that hydrolysis products of indole glucosinolates are bioactive compounds that might act as deterrent or toxin against insects or pathogens. Therefore plants with high indole glucosinolate content could be useful to control pests in a process known as biofumigation. In this regard, pak choi plants with greatly enhanced indole glucosinolate levels were analyzed for their ability to produce particular hydrolysis compounds of indole glucosinolates. The content and composition of these degradation products was determined by GC-MS. Besides indole-3-acetonitrile also degradation products of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate, namely 1-methoxy-indole-3-acetonitrile as well as 1-methoxy-indole-3-carbinol were detected from homogenized pak choi leaves (Table 2). Due to its reactivity it was anticipated not to find any isothiocyanate breakdown products of indole glucosinolates, as they are very unstable and immediately form the respective carbinole and thiocyanate. As expected, the levels of indole glucosinolate breakdown products were significantly higher in pak choi plants treated with methyl jasmonate when compared to controls and sum up to 66% of all glucosinolate degradation products determined. Although more 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate than indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate occurred in treated plants, breakdown products from 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate were lower in concentration (Table 2). This could be attributed to further breakdown and reactions of the formed 1-methoxy-indole-3-carbinole, as indole-3-carbinoles are reported to be very reactive compounds. Moreover, contrasting to the control methyl jasmonate, treated plants generated an additional breakdown product - the 1-methoxy-indole-3-carbinole (Table 2). According to Glatt et al. the alcohol of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate is the most mutagenic breakdown product suggesting that 1-methoxy-indole-3-carbinole might be a prominent compound in the plants defense strategy.Although indole glucosinolates are very common in Brassicaceae, glucosinolates with aliphatic side chains are usually dominating the chemical profile of cruciferous plants. This might be the reason that up to date indole glucosinolates are less explored for their impact on plant-insect interaction. However, recent studies using transgenic A. thaliana plants with increased indole glucosinolates and a doubling of 1-methoxy-indole-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate indicated specific differences in oviposition and survival rate of the phloem feeding insect Bemisia tabaci. There is also increasing evidence that the function of indole glucosinolates can be extended to defense against non-host fungal pathogens. In future experiments pak choi plants with highly increased indole glucosinolate levels will be a valuable tool to analyze the specific defense function of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate and its breakdown products in a natural setting with a variety of herbivores and pathogens. In addition, the specific contribution of 1-methoxy-indol-3-ylmethyl glucosinolate to biofumigation could be tested in different agricultural cultivation systems."}, "34500612": {"doi": "10.3390/molecules26175171", "title": "Analysis of Processing Effects on Glucosinolate Profiles in Red Cabbage by LC-MS/MS in Multiple Reaction Monitoring Mode", "abstract": "Red cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. var. capitata) continues to receive increasing attention on its health-promoting properties because of its high glucosinolate content. Glucosinolates are an unstable active substance; however, there are few studies on their changes in different cooking processes. In this study, we investigated the effects of processing methods (boiling, steaming, microwave heating, frying, stir-frying) and boiling time on glucosinolates in red cabbage. Ten glucosinolates, including 4-methoxyglucobrassicin, neoglucobrassicin, glucoalyssin, glucobrassicin, glucoraphanin, glucoiberin, progoitrin, gluconapin and sinigrin, in red cabbage were detected. Decreases of 32.36%, 24.83%, 25.27%, 81.11% and 84.29% for total glucosinolates were observed after boiling, microwaving, steaming, frying and stir-frying. Indole glucosinolates were more efficiently lost compared to aliphatic glucosinolates after boiling, while microwaving, steaming, frying and stir-frying also resulted in a greater reduction in indole glucosinolates than aliphatic glucosinolates. Glucoalyssin, glucoerucin and sinigrin were more thermal sensitive than other glucosinolates. It was confirmed that microwaving and steaming retained higher levels of glucosinolates than other methods and may be better for cooking red cabbage.", "intro": "1. IntroductionRed cabbage is popular worldwide and is beneficial due to its taste and intense red color, which increases the esthetic value of the food. It has received increasing attention because of its health-promoting properties, which are mostly ascribed to glucosinolates. Glucosinolates are a group of sulfur-containing secondary plant metabolites that are also known as beta-D-thioglucoside-N-hydroxy sulfates, (Z)-(or cis)-N-hydroxyimino sulfate esters, or S-glucopyranosyl thiohydroximates. The side chain, R, is highly variable and, up to now, there has been more than 200 glucosinolates identified. Red cabbage is mainly consumed by a variety of thermal cooking methods; these thermal treatments will further alter the glucosinolate content by mechanisms including enzyme breakdown by myrosinase upon cell lysis, thermal breakdown, and leaching into the heating medium. Each cooking method involves specific conditions that lead to various degrees of impact on the glucosinolate content. Both glucosinolates and their decomposition products exhibit important biological activities. In conventional cooking, such as steaming, heating begins at the surface of the food and heat is slowly transferred to the center by conduction. Conversely, in microwave cooking, microwaves permeate to the center of the food and the heat generated within the food is transferred toward the surface. In this respect, an equivalent rise in temperature occurs more quickly during microwave processing than steaming. Hence, the effects of various cooking methods (i.e., boiling, steaming, microwaving, stir-frying or frying) and a broad range of boiling times on glucosinolate content in red cabbage were studied in this research.Traditionally, gas chromatography (GC) was adopted for the identification and quantification of individual glucosinolates. However, pre-column derivatization or conversion to volatile desulpho-glucosinolate derivatives has to be carried out, and some glucosinolates, particularly those containing indoles, are thermally unstable, making them unsuitable for GC. Alternatively, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) becomes the preferred analytical method. HPLC has the advantage of directly determining glucosinolates. In the application of identification and confirmation structures, it can be coupled to mass spectrometry (MS). MS has proved to be an invaluable tool in the identification and structural elucidation of glucosinolates. Hence, HPLC and MSn with electrospray ionization (HPLC-ESI/MSn) is widely used to identify the individual glucosinolates in plants. However, most published methods for mass spectrometric analysis of glucosinolates required complex sample pretreatment. Tian et al. developed a selective and sensitive quantitative method using liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry with selected reaction monitoring detection, which can determine individual intact glucosinolates without conversion to desulfoglucosinolates. SIM is selected ion monitoring, and it only selects the primary parent ion. MRM is multiple reaction monitoring, which selects the parent ion at first and then selects a daughter ion. Hence, the selectivity of MRM is higher than that of SIM.In this study, we applied a rapid quantitative method for glucosinolate determination in red cabbage using high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS/MS) with MRM, exhibiting superior sensitivity and selectivity. Ten individual glucosinolates in red cabbage were quantitatively determined. The method was first used to investigate the effects of processing methods and boiling time on glucosinolates in red cabbage and identified which glucosinolates were more stable during processing to determine the best cooking method.", "results": "2. Results and Discussion2.1. Effect of Cooking Treatment on Proximate Composition in Red CabbagesDuring cooking, various chemical and physical changes alter the proximate composition of red cabbage. Table 1 shows the proximate composition of the samples after being subjected to different cooking conditions. The results show that all cooking treatments increased crude fat but decreased crude protein and ash content. Boiling, microwaving and frying induced an increase in crude fiber, while the other two cooking methods, steaming and stir-frying, induced a decrease in crude fiber. The crude fat content of the stir-fried sample was much higher than those of raw or other cooked samples, mainly due to the absorption of fat by the red cabbage. Murniece et al. obtained similar results to us, finding that the crude fiber content of deep-fat-fried samples was higher than in uncooked samples. The reason suggested by Sun et al. (2014) was that frying caused structural damage to vegetable cells, leading to a significant loss in liposoluble constituents and a consequential increase in the fiber content. The crude protein and ash content decreased to a greater extent after stir-frying (from 19.12 to 8.3 and from 7.68 +- 0.02 to 4.07 +- 7.53 g/100 g dry weight (DW)) than after applying the other cooking methods. Sun et al. (2014) found reductions in crude protein content after boiling, steaming, and microwaving, while frying increased crude fat content significantly, which was consistent with our results. The ash content decreased significantly after frying and stir-frying in our study. This result was in agreement with that reported by Gidamis et al., who found a significant reduction in ash content as a result of cooking. The effects of boiling time on proximate composition in red cabbage were also determined (Table 2). When boiling time was increased from 0 to 30 min, a gradual decrease in ash content (from 7.68 +- 0.02 to 5.74 +- 9.14 g/100 g DW) and a gradual increase in crude fiber content (from 4.52 +- 2.46 to 13.28 +- 0.01 g/100 g DW) were observed. Although not appreciably changed, the crude fat content increased at first (6.77 +- 0.50 to 12.96 +- 0.16 g/100 g DW from boiling for 1 min), followed by a decreasing trend (12.96 +- 0.16 to 6.20 +- 0.25 g/100 g DW comparing boiling for 1 min to 30 min). In contrast, the crude protein content decreased at first, followed by an increasing trend and restoring to the original level after boiling for 20 min. Few data are available on the effect of boiling time on proximate composition, so the present study provides a reference for other researchers.2.2. Identification of Individual Glucosinolate in Red CabbageThe glucosinolate profile of red cabbage was analyzed by a total ion chromatogram (TIC) precursor ion scan (Figure 1). However, the peak signals for some glucosinolates (i.e., sinigrin, progoitrin and glucoraphanin) were overlapping in the TIC. All of the glucosinolates were identified by their [M-H]- ions and their molecular weight. The precursor ion scan revealed peaks at m/z 358, 372, 388, 420, 422, 436, 447, 450 and 477, representing sinigrin, gluconapin, progoitrin, glucoerucin, glucoiberin, glucoraphanin, glucobrassicin, glucoalyssin, 4-methoxy glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin, respectively, and Figure 2 shows data for typical glucosinolates, including glucoerucin, glucobrassicin, 4-methoxy glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin. This profile of the ten main glucosinolates found in red cabbage is in agreement with previous reports. Additionally, 4-methoxy glucobrassicin and neoglucobrassicin are isomers that differ only in the position of a methoxy group. Hence, they were differentiated by reference to the reported elution sequence during reversed-phase HPLC. Quantitative determination of glucosinolates in red cabbage can be achieved by a combination of adequate component separation and appropriate detection selectivity. The discriminating characteristic of LC-MS/MS using MRM detection is its superior sensitivity and selectivity. The negative ion MS/MS used in the present study showed that the MS/MS of the deprotonated glucosinolates parent ([M-H]-) generated a characteristic fragment with m/z 97 ([SO3H]-), facilitating MRM in the MS/MS studies. The MRM of the transition [M-H]- to m/z 97 was used to quantify each glucosinolates. Ten glucosinolates were determined simultaneously during the analysis, providing improved sensitivity and selectivity compared to selected ion monitoring techniques. Quantification was conducted according to the literature. Molar absorption coefficients (lambda = 235 nm) for sinigrin (epsilonmol = 6780), glucoiberin (epsilonmol = 6234), glucoerucin (epsilonmol = 6531) and progoitrin (epsilonmol = 4130 +- 135) were used to quantify. The linearity and precision of the method were evaluated within the dynamic range of interest. The UV absorbance of the glucosinolates was used to calculate their concentration.2.3. Variation of Individual and Total Glucosinolate Content in Cooked Red CabbageTable 3 shows the individual and total glucosinolate content of red cabbage after different cooking treatments. The results reveal that after frying treatment, including frying and stir-frying, the total glucosinolate content decreased by 81.11% and 84.29%, respectively. Both microwaving and steaming produced smaller reductions in total glucosinolates compared to boiling (24.83%, 25.27% and 32.36%, respectively). Similar results were obtained by Verkerk et al. and Xu et al.. As thermally unstable secondary plant metabolites, total glucosinolates levels were significantly reduced because of degradation into isothiocyanate, thiocyanate and nitrile at the high temperatures of frying and stir-frying. The aqueous solubility of glucosinolates is the reason that boiling caused more glucosinolate loss than steaming or microwaving. However, in the report by Verkerk et al., the glucosinolate content was increased after microwave treatment. This may be due to differences in the red cabbage variety used, pretreatment and analysis methods. Therefore, systematic analysis of the effect of cooking methods on red cabbage is needed.Glucosinolates are usually classified into aliphatic, aromatic and indole glucosinolates and only aliphatic and indole glucosinolates are present in red cabbage. Aliphatic glucosinolates decompose into volatile isothiocyanates (responsible for pungent taste), whereas indole glucosinolates form indole compounds that are inhibitors of carcinogenesis.2.3.1. Effect of Cooking on Indole Glucosinolates in Red CabbageIn red cabbage, glucobrassicin (7.1302 mumol/g DW) is the predominant glucosinolate, one of whose degradation products, 3-indolemethanol, can prevent mammary carcinogenesis. Neoglucobrassicin and 4- methoxy glucobrassicin are also indole glucosinolates that are present in red cabbage. Frying caused the greatest reductions in glucobrassicin, neoglucobrassicin and 4- methoxy glucobrassicin (78.65%, 98.54% and 70.27%, respectively), followed by stir-frying (75.78%, 82.58% and 59.16%, respectively). Microwaving and seaming induced less reductions on glucobrassicin (19.63% and 13.39%, respectively) and neoglucobrassicin (6.33%, 17.65%, respectively) than boiling, whereas boiling for 3 min retained the highest 4- methoxy glucobrassicin content. On an overall level, red cabbage lost more indole glucosinolates than aliphatic glucosinolates after boiling for 3 min, showing the opposite effect to those of other cooking methods.The breakdown products from indole glucosinolates have been identified as phytoalexins, which contribute to plant defense. In particular, 3-indolemethanol, because of its biological activity in the prevention of mammary carcinogenesis, is a potential chemo-preventive agent. It is widely accepted that indole glucosinolates of Brassica vegetables are thermally less stable than aliphatic ones during heat treatment. To retain the indole glucosinolate ingredient, the cooking method of microwaving is recommended for cooking red cabbage, followed by steaming.2.3.2. Effect of Cooking on Aliphatic Glucosinolates in Red CabbageAliphatic glucosinolates exhibit a variety of biological activities in humans. There are four aliphatic glucosinolates that are found in relatively high levels in red cabbage, including glucoraphanin (1.3527 mumol/g), glucoerucin (1.3083 mumol/g), progoitrin (1.6057 mumol/g) and gluconapin (1.4480 mumol/g) (Table 3). Glucoraphanin is a precursor of the autism spectrum disorder treatment and anti-cancer compound, sulforaphane. The anti-carcinogenic activity can be explained by the induction of Phase II detoxification enzymes or the inhibition of Phase I enzymes. Glucoerucin is a precursor of 4-methylthiobutyl isothiocyanate, which is responsible for a radish-like flavor. Good direct anti-oxidant activity of glucoerucin has been reported because of its ability to decompose hydroperoxides and hydrogen peroxide. Goitrin, a degradation product of progoitrin, is anti-nutritional, toxic and goitrogenic. However, as these goitrogenic compounds are all produced from chemically unstable isothiocyanates, the occurrence of these substances is dependent on enzymatic degradation, protein cofactors, and processing conditions. Further studies are needed in this respect. The anti-carcinogenic activity of progoitrin hydrolysis products has been reported by Cartea et al.. Gluconapin is a precursor of 3-butenyl isothiocyanate, which is responsible for pungency and aroma. However, knowledge on the effects of cooking on the thermal stability of aliphatic glucosinolates in red cabbage is scarce. It can be seen from Table 3 that frying and stir-frying resulted in excessive losses in glucoraphanin (82.06% and 83.94%, respectively), glucoerucin (92.48% and 98.26%, respectively), progoitrin (88.29% and 79.94%, respectively) and gluconapin (92.29% and 95.88%, respectively). Boiling, microwaving and steaming decreased glucoraphanin by 16.23%, 13.02% and 6.06%. Microwaved cabbage retained the highest gluconapin content, with only a 5.67% loss, followed by steaming (26.01%) and boiling (27.41%), while cabbage boiled for 3 mins retained the highest progoitrin content, with 3.81% loss, respectively. High thermolability of glucoerucin and progoitrin has been reported. In the present study, boiling, microwaving and steaming caused less than a 27.41% reduction in glucoraphanin, progoitrin and gluconapin but more than 65.93% in glucoerucin reductions, proving glucoerucin to be more thermally sensitive than progoitrin.Glucoalyssin, glucoiberin and sinigrin were present at low levels in red cabbage (0.8410, 0.6505 and 0.1358 mumol/g DW, respectively). Almost no research reported biological activity of glucoalyssin. Glucoiberin has been reported to be very thermolabile. Hydrolysis products of glucoiberin have been reported to suppress carcinogenesis, protecting human and animal cells. Sinigrin can produce volatile and bioactive 2-propenyl isothiocyanate, which is pungent, lachrymatory and has a bitter flavor, and 2-propenyl thiocyanate, which has horseradish and garlic-like properties. Stir-frying and frying induced significant losses in glucoalyssin (93.37% and 92.24%, respectively), glucoiberin (95.86% and 92.36%, respectively) and sinigrin (96.61% and 96.39%, respectively), much like the effect on the glucosinolates mentioned earlier. Boiling retained the highest glucoiberin levels, with only a 5.38% decrease, followed by steaming and microwaving (19.51% and 25.92%, respectively). Boiling, steaming and microwaving induced significant losses in glucoalyssin (42.67%, 30.75% and 91.71%, respectively) and sinigrin content (35.27%, 91.75% and 93.89%, respectively). It can be seen that the effect of microwaving on the loss of glucoalyssin and sinigrin was obviously greater than the effect on glucoiberin.2.3.3. Effect of Boiling Time on Glucosinolates in Red CabbageAs shown in Table 4, a gradual reduction in the total amount of three-indole glucosinolate content accounting for 55.84% of total glucosinolates was observed after boiling for 1 min (25.03%), 5 min (47.47%), 10 min (65.08%), 20 min (81.25%) and 30 min (83.81%), whereas aliphatic glucosinolate content decreased relatively slowly after boiling for 1 min (16.33%), 5 min (39.27%), 10 min (46.90%), 20 min (61.80%) and 30 min (69.24%,). This is somewhat in conjunction with Ciska and Kozlowska, who found that indole glucosinolates were more efficiently lost compared to aliphatic glucosinolates as a result of greater diffusion properties. All detected glucosinolate content except for glucoraphanin, glucoiberin, progoitrin and gluconapin lost more than 50% after boiling for 10 min, and total glucosinolates decreased by 57.05%. Rosa and Heaney boiled shredded cabbage for 10 min (vegetable-water ratio 1:5), finding reductions in excess of 50%, which is similar to the findings in our study. Glucoraphanin, glucoiberin and progoitrin showed less thermal sensitivity than other glucosinolates, whose content decreased slowly in the range from 1 min (6.79%, 4.66% and 0.32%, respectively) to 30 min (49.45%, 43.78% and 49.67%, respectively). Boiling time is important for glucobrassicin retention, and red cabbage boiled for less than 5 min kept nearly half of its glucobrassicins. It was likely that complete thermal inactivation had occurred in boiled red cabbage. The extent of hydrolysis of glucosinolates can be affected by myrosinase, which is partially or totally inactivated during heat treatment.Thus, all cooking methods decreased the content of glucosinolates in red cabbage. To some extent, our results are in agreement with those found by Jon Volden et al., who reported the effects of steaming and boiling on the glucosinolate content of red cabbage. Steaming resulted in high retention of glucosinolates, in line with that reported by Francisco et al.. Glucosinolates are water-soluble compounds and are usually lost during conventional cooking because of leaching into surrounding water, enzyme breakdown, or thermal breakdown. Moreover, degradation events at a high temperature may also occur, leading to the formation of volatile compounds and other compounds. Oerlemans et al. investigated the effect of thermal degradation in glucosinolates in myrosinase-deactivated red cabbage, finding that glucosinolates are relatively heat stable at temperatures <100  C. It is prudent to assume that a potential loss of glucosinolates is a function of leaching into the processing waters as well as the thermal cooking method. Overall, we have provided comprehensive data on the effects of different cooking methods, providing a reference for other researchers."}, "30939141": {"doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0213429", "title": "Seed glucosinolate yield is maximized by higher rates of sulfur nutrition than required for seed yield in condiment mustard (Brassica juncea L.)", "abstract": "Brassica crops require high amounts of inorganic sulfur (S) for optimum yield, and are characterized by the synthesis of S-rich glucosinolates (GSL). Although it is well established that seed and GSL yield can be increased by S fertilizer, the detailed relationship between S supply as primary source and the harvestable sinks of seed GSL and storage proteins is poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that Brassica juncea mustard seed acts as a secondary S sink, and so require a higher rate of S to achieve maximum seed GSL compared to rates required to attain maximum seed biomass. Our experimental strategy involved comparing responses to available S for seed biomass, GSL, and protein. This was carried out in a protected environment using sand culture for a high-GSL condiment-type homozygous B. juncea genotype. A low-GSL canola-type was used as a control, in order to establish a base-line of response. Significantly more S was required to achieve maximum seed GSL than was required to achieve maximum seed mass. Total seed protein content was not significantly affected by increased S. The high-GSL line appeared to have an efficient mechanism of S supply to the secondary S sink, given the observed increase in seed S with increased S availability. From a practical point of view, increases in seed GSL with S availability suggests that S fertilizer rates should be optimized for maximum seed GSL yield, rather that optimizing for seed yield, as occurs for most other crops.", "intro": "IntroductionOleiferous brassicas such as canola (Brassica napus), Indian mustard and condiment mustard (B. juncea) and Chinese cabbage, sarson and Indian rapeseed (B. rapa) require high amounts of inorganic sulfur (S) supply for optimum yield. This can be up to 5-8 times the amount required for wheat. Most inorganic S in the mature seed of brassica is sequestered in the storage proteins cruciferin and napin, and in the secondary metabolite glucosinolate (GSL). GSLs have a wide range of beneficial effects in crop production and plant defense, with some contributing positively to human nutrition, such as the anti-tumorigenic 4 carbon (C4) side-chain aliphatic GSL glucoraphanin found in broccoli (B. oleracea var. italica). In contrast, anti-nutritional effects of GSLs on livestock have led to the secondary domestication and widespread cultivation of canola-type rapeseed containing low seed C3 and C4 side-chain aliphatic GSLs. Canola now plays an important role in cereal rotations of global temperate arable systems.Brassica seed contains high quality vegetable protein with balanced amino acid composition. Compared with other grains such as soybean, the composition of brassica seed protein is closer to FAO recommendations for humans, having 3-4% of S-containing amino acids. Brassica seed storage proteins typically represent up to 30% of seed mass with 60% of the total protein represented by globulin-like cruciferins (cru) and 20% by 2S albumin-type napins (nap). Interestingly, a close negative correlation has been detected in B. napus between seed storage protein (cru/nap) ratio and GSL content. However, the allergenicity of napins in humans continues to limit the use of protein-rich brassica seed meal.The interaction between S availability and the S-rich GSL secondary metabolites has long drawn the attention of agronomists and plant breeders. We recently reviewed the current understanding of the many underlying mechanisms that affect the interaction between S availability and seed GSL concentration. Much of this knowledge has improved in recent years based on studies in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Brassicaceae), as well as in Brassica crop species. Inorganic sulfate, taken up by the plant, is reduced to organic S forms that include amino acids, glutathione, chloroplast lipids and GSLs, through S assimilation processes, with up to 8% of total plant S stored within GSL molecules. Based on molecular interactions between sulfate and GSL transporters, transcription factors and signaling molecules, we developed a provisional model to describe the key processes that could be targeted in crop breeding by focusing on modifying GSL and protein content. Our analysis indicated that the inherent genome complexity of Brassica species could play a major role in the regulation of S and GSLs, due to gene duplication and subsequent divergence driving ontogenetic plasticity during crop development.In order to build on this conceptual framework a detailed understanding of the distribution and remobilization of S and GSLs throughout Brassica crop development is required. By representing this in terms of primary and secondary sources and sinks for S and GSLs, there is scope to account for S flux in the secondary seed sink between the S components of storage proteins and GSL. Capitalising on the tendency of Brassica genotypes selected for low seed GSL content to have mutations in genes associated with specific GSL synthesis enzymes, it should be possible to generate diagnostic evidence about specific seed S sinks, and distinguish this from transporter or remobilization signals from primary or secondary S sources.In contrast to canola (Brassica napus, an allopolyploid comprised of A and C diploid genomes), higher levels of GSLs are often positively selected for their desirable culinary properties in the seeds of Indian mustard (B. juncea AB genome). This is possible due to the accumulation of the B-genome (B. nigra) derived C3 side-chain aliphatic GSL-sinigrin. Indian mustard is widely grown within its center of genetic diversity India and elsewhere as an oilseed crop, and also as a condiment mustard in other parts of the world. In Australia, three different types of B. juncea (juncea-canola, condiment mustard and industrial mustard) are grown as high-value crops for production of canola-quality oil and meal, condiment mustard and volatile-mustard-oil (VOM), respectively.In this study we test the hypothesis that within a, B. juncea line selected for high seed GSL concentration, the seeds act as a secondary S sink, and so plants require higher rates of S fertilizer (primary S source) to achieve maximum seed GSL yield compared to the rates required to attain maximum seed biomass and protein yield. We also test the hypothesis that the higher seed GSL yield associated with additional S supply results specifically from increases in sinigrin accumulation. Our experimental strategy involved comparing the response to applied S for seed biomass, GSL, and total protein yield. This was carried out in a protected environment using sand culture for a high-GSL condiment type homozygous B. juncea genotypes. We used a low-GSL canola-type genotype as a control, in order to establish a base line of response.", "results": "ResultsPlant growth and phenologyThe use of sand culture enabled the constant availability and control of nutrients throughout the cultivation of the plants. The set of 10 S concentrations covered the full response range for seed biomass, seed GSL and protein yield. At the lower S concentrations (75 to 150 muM) we observed yellowing of younger leaves in both lines, along with stunted growth indicating a deficiency. Flowering occurred from 60 to 65 days after sowing in both lines and was unaffected by S treatment.Total biomass, seed, glucosinolate and protein yield response to applied sulfur levelsBoth high- and low-GSL lines responded to S with an increase in total biomass, seed biomass, seed GSL and seed protein yield (S1 Fig). Maximum predicted total biomass (above ground parts) yield was around 10 g plant-1 in the high-GSL line, with a concentration of ~395 muM S in the nutrient solution required to achieve 90% maximum biomass yield (Fig 1a). In contrast, the maximum predicted total biomass yield for the low-GSL line was half that of the high-GSL line, and required 536 muM S (36% more) in the nutrient solution to achieve 90% maximum yield (Fig 1b).Maximum predicted seed biomass yield was 2 g plant-1 for the high-GSL line, and 1 g for the low-GSL line (Fig 1a and 1b). The S concentration in the nutrient solution required to achieve 90% maximum seed yield was 12% higher than that needed for maximum total biomass yield in the high-GSL line, and 47% higher than that needed for maximum total biomass yield in the low GSL line (Table 1).Seed GSL yield in the low-GSL line was low, with a predicted maximum seed GSL yield of 0.38 mg plant-1 (Fig 1d). The fitted model using Mitscherlich function indicated that a concentration of 490 muM S was required in the nutrient solution to achieve 90% maximum seed GSL yield, which was 61% lower than the S required to achieve maximum seed yield. In contrast, seed GSL yield in the high-GSL line reached 153 mg plant-1, with a concentration of 648 muM S required in the nutrient solution to achieve 90% of the maximum seed GSL yield (Fig 1c). This was almost 47% higher than the S rate required for maximum seed yield (Table 1). The predicted S concentrations required to achieve 90% maximum seed GSL yield was significantly higher than that required for seed yield in high-GSL line (Table 1).Maximum predicted seed protein yield in the high-GSL line reached up to 319 mg plant-1, whereas in the low-GSL line the maximum predicted protein yield was only 40% of this (126.6 mg) (Table 1). The S concentration required to achieve 90% maximum seed protein was significantly less (45%; P <0.05) than that required for seed yield in the low-GSL line (Fig 1f; Table 1). However, in the high-GSL line the S concentration in the nutrient solution required to achieve 90% maximum seed protein yield was not significantly different from maximum seed yield (Fig 1e).Fitted S response curves of seed GSL yield against seed protein yield for the low-GSL line showed that a higher S concentration (about 10%) could increase seed protein yields and had no effect on seed GSL (Fig 1h). In contrast, for the high-GSL line the fitted curves showed that higher S concentration (28%) led to higher seed GSL yield, rather than an increase in seed protein (Fig 1g).Response of seed glucosinolate concentrations and glucosinolate fractions to sulfurTotal seed GSL concentration for the high-GSL line increased from 25 to 208 mumol g-1 with increased supply of S (S2 Table). As expected, C3 side-chain aliphatic GSL-sinigrin was the major GSL fraction in this line, accounting for 99.3% of the total detected GSLs regardless of S treatment (S3 Table). The relative proportions of the minor C4 side-chain aliphatic GSL-progoitrin and gluconapin, and also the aromatic GSL-gluconasturtiin, were signifincatly affected by S supply (S2 Table). However, these values do not make a significant contribution to the seed S sink, and are of limited practical relevance given that they represent <1% of total seed GSL content.The low-GSL line had only 0.3% of the seed GSL content of the high-GSL line. Although the C4-gluconapin proportion of total GSLs found in the low-GSL line was significantly affected by S treatment, such changes are of limited relevance since the total concentration of GSLs in the seeds of this line was only 0.03-1.7 mumol g-1 of seed (S3 Table).Effect of sulfur level on aboveground sulfur accumulation and partitioningThe accumulation of S in the seed and stalk straw of both low- and high-GSL lines generally increased with increased S supply (Fig 2). In the low-GSL line, seed S concentration significantly increased only up to 400 muM S in the nutrient solution, with no further increase at higher S levels (Table 2). For the high-GSL line, there was a consistent significant increase of seed S concentration with higher S supply up to the highest S level (1000 muM) (Table 2).The S accumulated in the seeds of the high-GSL line was 5.3 times higher than that of the low-GSL line, irrespective of S level in the nutrient solution (S4 Table). However, S content of the stalk straw was similar in both lines (Fig 2.)"}, "23365011": {"doi": "10.1631/jzus.B1200096"}, "17334923": {"doi": "10.1007/s10886-006-9245-2", "title": "Jasmonic Acid-Induced Changes in Brassica oleracea Affect Oviposition Preference of Two Specialist Herbivores", "abstract": "Jasmonic acid (JA) is a key hormone involved in plant defense responses. The effect of JA treatment of cabbage plants on their acceptability for oviposition by two species of cabbage white butterflies, Pieris rapae and P. brassicae, was investigated. Both butterfly species laid fewer eggs on leaves of JA-treated plants compared to control plants. We show that this is due to processes in the plant after JA treatment rather than an effect of JA itself. The oviposition preference for control plants is adaptive, as development time from larval hatch until pupation of P. rapae caterpillars was longer on JA-treated plants. Total glucosinolate content in leaf surface extracts was similar for control and treated plants; however, two of the five glucosinolates were present in lower amounts in leaf surface extracts of JA-treated plants. When the butterflies were offered a choice between the purified glucosinolate fraction isolated from leaf surface extracts of JA-treated plants and that from control plants, they did not discriminate. Changes in leaf surface glucosinolate profile, therefore, do not seem to explain the change in oviposition preference of the butterflies after JA treatment, suggesting that as yet unknown infochemicals are involved.", "intro": "IntroductionPlants can be attacked by many herbivorous insects and have evolved a variety of defense strategies, including morphological barriers, synthesis of toxic or repellent secondary metabolites, and the release of synomones that attract natural enemies of the herbivores. These defenses can be constitutive, i.e., expressed independent of the presence of an attacker, or inducible, in which case defense compounds accumulate in response to attack (Karban and Baldwin,). Herbivores can detect induced defensive compounds and respond by avoiding these plants, which signal lower suitability as a host plant (Landolt,; De Moraes et al.,; Kessler and Baldwin,; Meiners et al.,). Induced plant defense can affect herbivorous insects directly through the production of toxic compounds or indirectly through the production of cues that indicate intra- or interspecific competition for the herbivores (Schoonhoven et al.,). Moreover, induced plant defense signals can reduce the enemy-free space for the herbivores. For parasitoids and predators, induced infochemicals may indicate the presence of their host or prey on the plant (Turlings et al.,; Dicke and Vet,). Phenotypic changes in individual plants may therefore affect insects at different trophic levels, and thus, the composition of the insect community and food web associated with the plant (Price et al.,; Van Zandt and Agrawal,; Takabayashi et al.,).Already in the 19th century, Kirby and Spence observed that Pieris brassicae females preferred to lay their eggs on plants devoid of eggs. Later, this was confirmed under more controlled conditions by Rothschild and Schoonhoven for both P. brassicae and Pieris rapae. This avoidance of infested plants is caused by a physiological response of the plant to oviposition, rather than by compounds excreted by the butterflies themselves (Blaakmeer et al.,). The butterflies also avoid egg deposition on leaves with feeding larvae (Rothschild and Schoonhoven,). It was postulated that butterflies avoid laying eggs on herbivore-infested plants because herbivore attack induces defense compounds in plants that can influence the performance of their offspring and to reduce the risk of inter- or intraspecific competition and parasitism (Thompson and Pellmyr,; Shiojiri et al.,). Egg-induced chemical changes in Brassica plants are also known to arrest Trichogramma parasitoids that parasitize Pieris eggs (Fatouros et al.,).Oviposition-site selection involves an important behavioral decision in the life cycle of an herbivorous insect because hatching larvae have limited dispersal capacity (Renwick and Chew,). P. rapae is a solitary butterfly that lays one egg at a time, whereas P. brassicae is gregarious and lays batches of about 20-100 eggs. P. rapae appears to spread the risk of larval mortality, laying few eggs within any patch. This has the advantage of being able to exploit isolated plants (Davies and Gilbert,). P. brassicae, however, needs patches of plants because one large egg batch will require more than one plant for all caterpillars to develop into adults. Oviposition-site selection is performed in consecutive phases of searching and contact evaluation. P. rapae butterflies use visual, olfactory and tactile cues during these phases (Rothschild and Schoonhoven,; Renwick and Radke,). Acceptance of a site may be determined by the balance of positive and negative factors (Renwick and Radke,). Renwick and Radke suggest that olfaction does not play a role in attraction to a host plant, but may be involved in avoidance of non-host plants. P. rapae and P. brassicae are crucifer specialists and are known to use glucosinolates, toxic secondary metabolites characteristic for Brassicaceae, as oviposition stimulants. Glucobrassicin and sinigrin are effective oviposition stimulants for P. brassicae and P. rapae (Renwick et al.,; Van Loon et al.,).A major signal-transduction pathway involved in induced plant defense is the octadecanoid pathway (Arimura et al.,). A central compound in the pathway is jasmonic acid (JA), which has an important role in direct and indirect defense in many plant species. In response to JA or methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment, increased concentrations of several compounds have been documented in a range of plant species, e.g., proteinase inhibitors (Moura and Ryan,), polyphenol oxidases (Thaler et al.,), nicotine (Baldwin et al.,), trypsin inhibitors (Cipollini and Sipe,), glucosinolates (Cipollini and Sipe,; Van Dam et al.,; Mewis et al.,), and increased volatile emission (Boland et al.,; Dicke et al.,; Koch et al.,).Herbivores are reported to be affected by JA treatment of plants. Several studies have focused on the larval stage of the herbivores and have shown reduced relative growth rates and leaf consumption (Van Dam et al.,; Gols et al.,; Van Dam et al.,). In field experiments, spraying of JA decreased the abundance of caterpillars, flea beetles, aphids, and thrips (Thaler et al.,). Other studies addressed the influence of JA application to plants on oviposition-site selection behavior of adult herbivores. These studies showed that JA application can result in induced resistance as well as induced susceptibility (Stanjek et al.,; Kessler and Baldwin,; Lu et al.,).Here, we studied how JA application affects oviposition of two specialist herbivores on cabbage, Pieris rapae L. and P. brassicae L. (Lepidoptera: Pieridae) that are closely related, yet differ drastically in the amount of eggs they put on one plant. Our study is the first to compare closely related herbivores with a different oviposition strategy, which might affect the consequences of JA-induced responses. JA is known to mediate the induction of chemical defense responses in plants to feeding damage and deposition of eggs (Dicke and Van Poecke,; Hilker and Meiners,; Mumm and Hilker,). By using JA, we were able to examine the effects of induced defense responses in cabbage. Moreover, JA application has the advantage that visually detectable damage and the presence of herbivores or eggs are avoided. Finally, JA allows control over the strength of induction through controlled dosages. We hypothesized that JA treatment would inhibit the oviposition of the butterflies. We made solvent extracts to address the identity of the active plant compounds that influenced butterfly behavior. Rather than testing whole-leaf extracts, however, we extracted the glucosinolates from the surface of both control and JA-treated plants and tested the oviposition preference of the butterflies for these glucosinolate fractions on a neutral substrate. Furthermore, we included a control experiment to exclude a potential direct effect of JA on oviposition behavior. We addressed the following questions: (1) does JA treatment of cabbage plants affect host plant selection of the two Pieris butterfly species; (2) are there differences between solitary and gregarious butterflies; (3) does JA treatment affect glucosinolate levels in leaf surface extracts; and (4) do changes in glucosinolate levels determine the changes in oviposition preference?", "results": "ResultsChemical Analysis Five GLS were detected in B. oleracea leaf surface samples: glucoiberin, sinigrin, 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin, glucobrassicin, and 4-methoxyglucobrassicin (Table 1). No significant difference was detected between JA-treated and control leaves for the total amount of GLS per cm2. The amounts of glucobrassicin, the most abundant glucosinolate in these samples, 4-methoxyglucobrassicin, and sinigrin, did not significantly differ between control and JA-treated leaves. The amounts of glucoiberin and 4-hydroxyglucobrassicin collected in the leaf surface extracts were significantly lower for JA-treated leaves compared to control leaves (Table 1). The same results were obtained when calculated for the GLS content expressed as nmol per mg dry weight (not shown).  Herbivore Oviposition Preference: Surface Application of JA As P. brassicae lays its eggs in batches, both the number of egg batches and the number of eggs per leaf were counted. For the 1 mM JA treatment, the number of batches was significantly lower on JA-treated leaves than on control leaves (N = 36, Z = -2.628, P = 0.009, Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-ranks test), and the total number of eggs was significantly lower as well (N = 36, Z = -2.035, P = 0.042, Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-ranks test). For the 0.1-mM JA treatment, the result was similar (N = 27, batches: Z = -2.223, P = 0.026; eggs: Z = -2.138, P = 0.032, Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-ranks test) (Fig. 1). Experiments with 0.01 mM JA application did not show discrimination by the butterflies between the treated and control leaves (results not shown). Also, P. rapae butterflies significantly preferred to oviposit on control leaves compared to JA-treated leaves (Fig. 2). The leaves treated with the two highest concentrations of JA tested, 1 and 0.1 mM, were avoided in favor of the control leaves (paired t-test, respectively, t = 3.805, df = 23, P = 0.001 and t = 3.681, df = 23, P = 0.001). The lowest concentration of JA tested, i.e., 0.01 mM, did not affect the distribution of eggs over the leaves (t = -0.662, df = 23, P = 0.52, paired t-test). Systemic Uptake of JA In the experiment with P. rapae that employed systemic uptake of JA through the petiole, the same result was obtained: the number of eggs on the JA-treated leaves (10.0 +- 1.57) was lower than on the control (19.12 +- 2.82) leaves (t = 3.976, df = 31, P < 0.001, paired t-test).Effect of Pure JA on Oviposition Preference When paper treated with sinigrin and JA was compared to paper with only sinigrin, there was no difference in the number of eggs the butterflies deposited on the two substrates (t = -0.438, df = 26, P = 0.67, paired t-test) (Fig. 3). These results show that the observed effect of the JA treatment on herbivore oviposition behavior was due to induced changes in leaf tissue rather than to a direct repellent or deterrent effect of JA itself. Bioassays with Purified Glucosinolate Fractions The butterflies did not discriminate between the two GLS fractions (Table 2), the number of eggs on paper with the GLS from control plants, and the number of eggs on paper with GLS from JA-treated plants was not different for either concentration (concentration 6 gle: Z = -1.514, N = 20, P = 0.130, Wilcoxon matched-pair signed-ranks test; 48 gle: t = -0.523, df = 19, P = 0.607, paired t-test) (Fig. 4).  Performance of P. rapae Caterpillars About two-thirds of the caterpillars survived until pupation, and a similar number of caterpillars reached the pupal stage on both treatments, 19 on control and 18 on JA-treated plants (Fig. 5). The caterpillars on JA-treated plants pupated on average after 15 d, while the caterpillars on the control plants pupated significantly sooner, on average after 13 d (Mann-Whitney U, Z = -4.071, P < 0.001). The average pupal weight on the control plants, 165 +- 3.4 mg, was similar to that on the JA-treated plants, 158 +- 3.3 mg (ANOVA, F = 2.665, df = 1, P = 0.112).

IntroductionBrassica napus L. (rapeseed, canola, oilseed rape, OSR) is grown worldwide for the production of vegetable oil, biodiesel, and protein-rich rapeseed meal (RSM) after oil extraction. A current major breeding aim in oilseed rape is to improve the quality of RSM by enhancing protein quality and quantity and reducing levels of anti-nutritional compounds, such as seed fibre and glucosinolates. The indigestible fibre present in the seed coat, including lignin, cellulose, and hemicellulose components, is the main anti-nutritional compound in black-seeded oilseed rape, which affects the taste and appearance of RSM and limits its use as a poultry feed. The fibre also has a negative effect on seed oil and protein content in B. napus, as the synthesis of cellulose and hemicellulose redirects photosynthetic assimilates from oil and protein into sugar biosynthesis, which may result in reduced content of these two compounds.Much effort has been put into the research of yellow and light-colour seeded genotypes of OSR since such genotypes have thinner seed coats, less fibre, and higher seed oil and protein content. However, these yellow-seeded genotypes have not been successfully introduced into the market due to other unfavourable agronomic traits. Seed coat colour is a difficult morphological marker for selection due to its low heritability, multiple gene inheritance, and maternal and environmental effects (light, temperature) regulating the trait. Fibre, when compared to seed colour, is a more stable trait for selection; therefore, understanding the genetic mechanism regulating seed fibre content is essential in improving seed oil content and meal value of B. napus.Numerous studies have been performed to identify QTL for seed colour and fibre content with different effects in different genetic backgrounds. However, many of these studies revealed one major locus on chromosome A09 that explained most of the trait variation. The QTL for fibre and seed colour are linked, as the biochemical pathways leading to the synthesis of these two economically important traits have common precursors, such as p-coumarate. Although the genetic mechanism of seed fibre and colour biosynthesis have been extensively studied in Arabidopsis, the identification of their functional orthologs and understanding their mode of action in B. napus remains challenging. The complexity of the B. napus genome, which is characterised by multi-gene families, homeologous exchanges, and gene presence/absence variation (PAV), further complicates the identification of key genes regulating important agronomic traits across different environments and cultivars of oilseed rape. However, whilst the latest genotyping technologies and bioinformatics allowed the identification of some candidate genes regulating fibre content and seed colour in B. napus, further investigations are required.Here we performed QTL mapping analysis to unravel the genetic basis of traits affecting RSM quality, including seed oil, protein, fibre, glucosinolate, and seed coat colour using a doubled haploid (DH) mapping population derived from a cross between lines with high variation for fibre traits: yellow-seeded 'Z114' and black-seeded 'M305'. The aim of the study was to identify SNPs significantly associated with the traits of interest in order to establish candidate genes and develop genetic markers that could be used in breeding programmes aimed to improve RSM.", "results": "2. Results2.1. Phenotypic AnalysisSeed oil content (SOC), seed protein content (SPC), seed coat colour (SCC), neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), glucosinolates (GLS): 4OH-glucobrassicin (4OH-gbsGLS), glucobrassicin (gbsGLS), glucobrassicanapin (gbnGLS), gluconapin (gnaGLS), napoleiferin (napGLS), progroitrin (proGLS), sum of alkene glucosinolates (sum_alkGLS) and total glucosinolate content (sumGLS) of the M305 x Z114 mapping population were measured in three replicates over two years of study. Extensive phenotypic variation was observed for all the traits (Table 1), but the largest variation was found for SCC, ADF, and NDF. The genotype (G), environment (E), and genotype by environment (G x E) interaction exhibited significant effects on all the traits (p < 0.01) (Table 1).A strong negative correlation was observed between SCC-ADF/NDF and a weak correlation between SCC and GLS. In addition, ADF and NDF showed a weak correlation with SPC, SOC, and GLS (Figure 1). The correlations between these traits gave rise to common QTL for these traits.2.2. Genome-Wide Genotyping of the Mapping PopulationThe sequence coverage of the parental lines was around 18x and for the DH lines, ranged from 0.89 to 3.12x (Supplementary File 1). A total of 187,835 SNP markers generated using skim genotyping by sequencing were identified between the mapping parents M305 and Z114. Of these, 146,530 could be reliably placed within the genome and used for genetic mapping. The identified SNPs were distributed across the 19 chromosomes and ranged in number from 574 on chromosome A08 to 18152 on chromosome C07, with a mean of 7712 SNPs per chromosome. For the additional unplaced contigs in the reference assembly, the SNP counts were between 71 on A07_random and 2888 on C01_random, with a mean of 1878 per contig (Supplementary File Table S2).2.3. QTL Analysis for Seed Coat Colour, Seed Fibre, Glucosinolates, and Protein ContentTo search for loci associated with seed fibre (ADF, NDF), glucosinolates (GLS), seed oil content (SOC), seed protein content (SPC), and seed coat colour (SCC), we performed genetic mapping using a population comprising 78 DH lines derived from a cross between yellow-seeded (Z114) and black-seeded (M305) parents. In total, 11 QTL were detected in both years of trial data on chromosomes A02, A04, A06, C02, C02-random, C06, C07, and C08 with a LOD score > 4 (Table 2).QTL for GLS were detected on chromosomes A02 (position 6195793, 6195788) and A04 (position 2003804). On chromosome A04, the identified QTL included SPC (8953068) and SCC/ADF/NDF/GLS (position 18584190, 18185527). A QTL for SCC was detected on chromosome A06 (20531176). QTL for GLS were detected on chromosomes C02 (42759878) and C02-random (2378220) for GLS/SCC. Another QTL for SCC, NDF, and GLS was found on chromosome C06 (36138053) and for SCC and ADF on chromosome C07 (9412440, 9412501). On chromosome C08 (26100309), a QTL for SCC, NDF, and GLS was detected. In addition, on the same chromosome (position 35170742), a QTL for GLS was identified. Individual QTL could explain 21.52%-32.59% of the phenotypic variation (R2). The QTL for the other tested phenotypes (SOC, 4OH-gbsGLS) were detected only in an individual year of trial; hence, they were not analysed further (data not shown) as QTL found only in one year of a trial are not stable enough to become reliable genetic markers.2.4. Candidate Gene Prediction Underling QTL for Seed Coat Colour, Seed Fibre, Glucosinolates, and Protein ContentTo identify candidate genes that can be related to the regulation of SCC, ADF/NDF, GLS, and SPC, 11 QTL for these traits were identified in both years of field trials and analysed using the B. napus genome browser ( accessed from 1 October-30 November 2020) (Figure 2).Since the size of the detected QTL was relatively small (111 bp-405 kbp), the range of the genome screened for candidate genes was 1 Mbp upstream and downstream from the position of SNP identified as flanking the QTL in the genetic mapping study. The functional annotation of 71 possible candidate genes underlying the QTL was obtained from their homologous genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. A full list of genes that might be involved in the regulation of the studied traits affecting RSM quality is listed in Supplementary File Table S3 and Table 3.Several genes underlying the QTL with a predicted role in carbohydrate metabolism, cell wall, and seed development were identified in this study. The high correlation among SPC/GLS/SCC/ADF/NDF content (Figure 1) could result from pleiotropy or close linkage between genes controlling these traits. The Z114 x M305 mapping population is contrasting the most for fibre; for this reason, many selected candidates in the QTL regions for SPC and GLS include genes involved in carbohydrate and flavonoid biosynthesis. The functional impact of nonsynonymous SNPs in these genes and how they change the encoded amino acids is shown in Table 4. In the qGLS-A02 region, 18 candidate genes with 2-11 SNPs each were identified. The most interesting one, BnaA02g12160D encoding Korrigan2 (KOR2) that contains two missense variant SNPs, was located 7.5 kbp from the QTL. The five candidate genes underlying qGLS-A04 contained 1-4 SNPs each, where BnaA04g03060D, which encodes beta-1,3-glucanase 3 (BG3), contains three missense variant SNPs. Twenty candidate genes underlying qSPC-A04 contained 1-9 SNPs, where BnaA04g10260D encodes raffinose synthase 5/seed imbibition 1-like (RS5/ SIP1) contained four missense SNPs. Eight candidate genes underlying qSCC/ADF/NDF/GLS-A04 contained 1-4 SNP genetic variations. Among these, pectin methylesterase (PE) (BnaA04g27070D) is located 510 kbp from the QTL, and pectin lyase-like protein (PLL) (BnaA04g25420D) located 300 kbp from the QTL were identified. The A > C nucleotide substitution in PE and T > C missense variant SNPs found in the PLL gene lead to Asn/Thr and Val/Ala amino acid substitutions, respectively. The 19 genes in the region of qSPC-A06 contained between 1 and 18 genetic variants. One of the identified candidates is sucrose synthase 2 (SUC2) BnaA06g29670D with eight missense variant SNPs and one premature stop codon. The region of qGLS-C02 was found to have eight underlying candidate genes containing between 1 and 17 SNPs. BnaC02g38340D encodes transparent testa 10, laccase-like 15 (TT10/LAC15), and contains one missense variant. Another gene underlying this QTL, BnaC02g38710D, transparent testa 4 (TT4) encoding chalcone synthase, contains two missense SNPs. Five other candidate genes for fibre containing between 1 and 9 SNP variants were identified in the qSCC/NDF/GLS-C06 region. One of them, encoding Glycosyl hydrolase (GH) (BnaC06g38540D), was located 59.8 kbp from the QTL and contained six missense variant SNPs. Two other candidate genes underlying qADF/SCC-C07 include peroxidase 64 (PRX64) (BnaC07g05770D), located 173 kbp from the QTL, and RING-type E3 ubiquitin transferase (BnaC07g05860D) located 16.6 kbp from the QTL. Each of these genes contained two missense variant SNPs. Seven genes in qGLS-C08 were identified with between 1 and 19 SNPs. BnaC08g40570D, encoding cellulase/glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GH5), was located 563 kbp from qGLS-C08 and contained 10 missense SNP variants. One of four candidate genes in qSCC/NDF/GLS-C08, encoding UDP-glycosyl transferase 73C7 (UGT73C7) (BnaC08g24250D), is located 177 kbp from the QTL and contains a G>A missense variant SNPs causing Ser/Asn substitution.Identification of candidate genes associated with seed coat development, carbohydrate, and flavonoid biosynthesis in this study indicates that this approach can efficiently detect genes related to seed coat colour and fibre composition in B. napus seeds."}}
