A comprehensive profiling of polyphenols from five Brassica species microgreens was conducted using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography photo diode array high-resolution multi-stage mass spectrometry (UHPLC-PDA-ESI/HRMSn). A total of 164 polyphenols including 30 anthocyanins, 105 flavonol glycosides, and 29 hydroxycinnamic acid and hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives were putatively identified.The putative identifications were based on UHPLC-HRMSn analysis using retention times, elution orders, UV/Vis spectra and high resolution mass spectra, in-house polyphenol database, and as well as literature comparisons. This study showed that these five Brassica species microgreens could be considered as good sources of food polyphenols.", "intro": "INTRODUCTIONMicrogreens are young edible greens produced from vegetables, herbs, or other plants, ranging in size from five to ten centimeters long including stem and cotyledons (seed-leaves). They are popular for their pretty colors, intense flavors, delicate textures and relatively high nutritional contents. The entire plant (seedling) is harvested at the ground level when cotyledon or seed-leaves have fully expanded and before true leaves have fully emerged.The Brassicacae offers some of the most commonly consumed vegetables worldwide, which can be grown as microgreens. Five Brassica vegetables commonly found in the U.S. market place are red cabbage (B. oleracea var. capitata), purple kohlrabi (B. oleracea var. gongylodes), red and purple mustards (B. juncea), and mizuna (B. rapa var. nipposinica or B. juncea var. japonica). Brassica vegetables are known to be rich sources of ascorbic acid, carotenoids, glucosinolates, polyphenols, and tocopherols which have human-health beneficial attributes reportedly involved in preventing cardiovascular diseases and some types of cancers.Previous studies have tentatively identified phenolic compounds from 22 mature-leaf Brassica vegetables and phenolic compounds have been found in tronchuda cabbage (Brassica oleracia var. costata) seeds mature leaves inter-nodal shoots and roots. Twelve specific phenolic compounds have been profiled in two- to twelve-day old seedlings possessing both seed-leaves and true-leaves. The aim of the present study was to characterize and quantify the naturally occurring polyphenols in five commonly consumed Brassicas (mizuna, red cabbage, purple kohlrabi, red mustard and purple mustard) at their microgreen growth stage. The analyses of their native polyphenols and flavonol aglycones were performed using state-of art analytical tools: ultra high-performance liquid chromatography photo diode array high-resolution multistage mass spectrometry (UHPLC-PDA-ESI/HRMS/MSn). Results showed that Brassica microgreens contained notable levels of hydroxyl cinamic acids and may contain different compounds from their true-leaves. A total of 30 anthocyanins, 105 flavonol glycosides, and 29 hydroxycinnamic acid and hydroxylbenzoic acid derivatives were tentatively identified. This is the first known reported study of polyphenol compounds in vegetables at the cotlyledonary-leaf (microgreen) stage of growth of an array of Brassica microgreens.", "results": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONStrategies for Systematic Identification of Polyphenols from Microgreen BrassicaBrassicaceae polyphenol composition has been extensively investigated. The main flavonols in Brassica vegetables are the O-glycosides of quercetin, kaempferol, and isorhamnetin,. The sugar moiety found in Brassica vegetables is glucose, occurring as mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentaglucosides. They are also commonly found acylated by different hydroxycinnamic acids. Anthocyanins are another main class of flavonoid found in Brassica vegetables and cyanidin is the most common anthocyanidin in colored-leaf Brassica vegetables. Hydroxycinnamic acids (C6-C3) are phenolic acids characterized in Brassica vegetables with the most common ones being p-coumaric, caffeic, sinapic and ferulic acids; often found in conjugation with sugars or other hydroxycinnamic acids.The five Brassica species microgreen phenolic compounds exhibit absorbance maxima at three wavelengths (280 nm for flavonols and flavonol glycosides, 320 nm for hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives, and 520 nm for anthocyanins.HRMS was used for the determination of chemical formulas. Neutral loss information from MS was used for identification of sugar moiety and acyl groups. In MS analysis, cleavage of the first glycosidic linkage is expected to take place at the O-glycosidic bond at the 7-position of the flavonols and the 5-position of the anthocyanins, leading to the fragmentations [(M-H)-162]- for monohexosides and [(M-H)-324]- for dihexosides. The remaining glucose moieties of the flavonoid molecule are expected to be linked to the hydroxyl group at the 3-position of the aglycone. The disaccharide moieties of the flavonoids in Brassica species are mainly sophorosides. The MS fragmentation behavior can be used for the determination of interglucoside linkage and neutral losses of 180, 162, and 120 amu indicate a sophoroside with a 1 2 inter glucoside linkage, while loss of 324 amu, and in some cases low abundance of 162 amu, corresponds to a diglucoside with a 1 6 linkage like gentiobioside. The saccharides (mono-, di-, tri-saccharides) and acyl groups of flavonol glycoside and their possible neutral losses in CID MS/MS analysis are listed in Table 1, and the basic structures of the phenolic compounds found in these five Brassica species microgreens are shown in Figure 1.AnthocyaninsAmong the five Brassica species microgreen red cabbage, red mustard, purple mustard, and purple kohlrabi have red to purple colored seed-leaves. UHPLC chromatograms at 520 nm revealed 30 different anthocyanins are likely responsible for this coloration (Figure 2). The retention times (tR), HRMS masses [M]+ molecular formulas, errors (ppm) between theoretical and measured values, and major MS2 and MS3 product ions are summarized in Table 2.In these five Brassica species microgreens, only cyanidin (cy) derivatives were found, which is in accordance with the other studies on Brassicas. The anthocyanins found in red cabbage microgreens were cy-3-diglucoside-5-glucoside derivatives acylated with different hydroxycinnamic acids at the diglucosyl moiety in the 3-position. High resolution mass spectroscopic analysis with multi stage mass fragmentation was used as an important tool for anthocyanin characterization. Among the 30 cy glycosides found in red cabbage, red mustard, purple mustard and purple kohlarabi microgreens, peak 1 at m/z 773.2106 (C33H41O21, -1.36 mmu) was the lowest molecular weight anthocyanin and the losses of three hexosyl units were observed in MS2 spectra, suggesting cy-3-diglucoside-5-glucoside, a typical compound reported in red cabbage.The major acylated anthocyanins were cy-3-diglucoside-5-glucoside derivatives with various acylated groups e.g. coumaroyl, feruloyl and sinapoyl connected to the diglucoside. The MS/MS of most of the molecular ions of acylated anthocyanins gave the major product ions at m/z 449, a cy 5-glucoside residue, and at m/z 611, a cy-3-diglucoside residue. The MS/MS fragments of the acylated anthocyanins allow for a rough determination of the location of the acylating groups. Peaks 12, 13 and 14 are the major anthocyanins in microgreen red cabbage, and they were identified as cyanidin 3-di-feruloyl-sophoroside-5-glucoside, cy 3-(sinapoyl)(sinapoyl)sophoroside-5-glucoside and cy 3-(sinapoyl)(feruloyl)sophoroside-5-glucoside, respectivelyUsing peak 12 as an example, HRMS gave the [M]+ ion at 1125.3070, corresponding to the formula of C53H57O27. Fragmentation of ion at m/z 1125 in positive mode produced ions at m/z 963 by loss of a glucosyl residue (162 amu) from the 5-position. The ion at m/z 449 was produced by a total loss of 676 amu, corresponding to a di-feruloyl-diglucosyl residue (176 + 176 + 324 amu), from the terminal 3-positionIn previous study of purple kohlrabi, 12 anthocyanins have been identified. The major ones are cy 3-(feruloyl)(sinapoyl) diglucoside-5-glucoside, cy 3-(feruloyl) diglucoside-5-glucoside and cy 3-(sinapoyl)(sinapoyl) diglucoside-5-glucoside. In our study, the acylated anthocyanins with one malonyl group attached to the hexose of C-5 and other aromatic groups (caffeic, p-coumaric, sinapic or ferulic acid) attached to the C-3 glycosidic substituent were found. In the MS2 spectra, the fragment ions at (m/z 1023, 993 and 963), with the two acyl groups attached to the di-hexose of C-3 are usually observed as the base peak. This fragmentation pattern was evidenced with most anthocyanins analyzed and lead to the tentative identification of cy-3-(feruloyl)(feruloyl)diglucoside-5-(malonyl)-glucoside (m/z 1211, peak 19), cy 3-O-(sinapoyl)(feruloyl)diglucoside-5-O-(malonyl)glucoside (m/z 1241, peak 20), and cy 3-O-(sinapoyl)(sinapoyl)diglucoside-5-O-(malonyl)glucoside (m/z 1271, peak 21). Peaks 11a-14a were identified as cy 3-p-(coumaroyl)sophoroside-5-(malonyl)glucoside, cy 3-O-(pcoumaroyl)(sinapoyl) diglucoside-5-O-(malonyl) glucoside, cy 3-O-(feruloyl)glucoside-5-O-(malonyl)-glucoside and cy 3-O-(sinapoyl)glucoside-5-O-(malonyl)glucoside in red mustard microgreen. Peaks 19 and 20, were two major anthocyanins identified in red and purple mustard. Peaks 16b, 17b and 18b were identified as cy 3-(sinapoyl)(coumaroyl)-triglucoside-5-(malonyl)-glucoside, and cy 3-(coumaroyl)(sinapoyl)diglucoside-5-(malonyl)glucoside, respectively.O-Glycosylated Flavonols and Their Acylated DerivativesAcylated flavonoid glycosides were easily identified based on the increased mass of the parent ions and the wavelength maxima (330-336 nm) of their UV spectra (Figure 3). According to the MSn (n=2-5) data, the aglycones of the flavonol glycosides were quercetin (Qn), kaempferol (Km), and isorhamnetin (Is). Using the strategy described previously, 105 flavonol glycosides were characterized in five microgreen vegetables (Figure 3). Among them, 18 were non-acylated flavonoid glycosides, and 87 were acylated flavonoid glycosides. The compound distribution in these 5 microgreens is shown in Table 3. Qn 3-sophoroside-7-glucoside, Qn 3-hydroxyferuloylsophoroside-7-glucoside, Km 3-hydroxyferuloylsophoroside-7-glucoside, Km 3-sinapoylsophoroside-7-glucoside and Is 3-caffeoylsophoroside-7-glucoside, are common peaks in all five brassica species microgreens. Is 3-O-glucoside, Qn 3,7-di-O-glucoside, Km 3-pcoumaroyldiglucoside, Qn 3-caffeoylsophoroside, Qn 3-feruloylsophoroside, Qn 3-feruloylsophoroside-7-glucoside, and Km 3-sinapoylsophoroside were found only in mizuna microgreen, while Km 3-sinapoylsophoroside-7-glucoside and Qn 3-sinapoylsophorotrioside were found only in purple kohlrabi. Red cabbage microgreens had, Km 3-pcoumaroylsophorotrioside, Km 3-p-coumaroylsophoroside-7-diglucoside, km 3-hydroxyferuloylsophorotrioside-7-glucoside, Km 3-disinapoyldiglucoside-7-glucoside, Km 3-sinapoylferuloylsophoroside-7-glucoside and Qn 3-disinapoylsophorotrioside which were also found in mature red cabbage. Km 3-sophorotrioside-7-glucoside, Qn 3-caffeoylsophorotrioside-7-glucoside and Qn 3-hydroxyferuloylsophorotioside-7-glucoside only existed in microgreen of red mustard and purple mustard.Using MS analysis of peak a19, as an example, the deprotonated molecular ion at m/z 933 (C42H45O24) lost a hexosyl group from position 7, giving the product ion at m/z 771. The MS3 product ion revealed a loss of 162 amu, corresponding to a caffeoyl group, and a loss of dihexoxyl group at the 3-position (324 amu), leading to the Km aglycone (m/z 285). Thus, peak a19 was tentatively identified as Km 3-caffeoyldiglucoside-7-glucoside. Peak b13 also exhibited the deprotonated ion at m/z 933 but showed different fragmentation pathways. During the MS fragmentation of peak 18a, loss of 162 amu, corresponding to a hexosyl moiety at the terminal 7-position was observed. Further fragmentation of the acylated ion, m/z 625, gave the loss of pcoumaroyl group and the loss of a dihexosyl group, producing the Qn aglycone ion (m/z 301). Thus, peak b13 was assigned as Qn 3-p-coumaroyldiglucoside-7-glucoside. Using this strategy, the remaining flavonols were identified on the basis of HRMS, MS fragmentation pattern, UV maxima, and retention times as flavonols, previously characterized in the five Brassica species microgreens.Derivatives of Hydroxycinnamic Acids and Hydroxybenzoic acidsHydroxycinnamic acids and hydroxybenzoic acids are considered non-flavonoid phenolics and are characterized by their C6-C3 and C6-C structures, respectively. Most of the hydroxycinnamic acids and hydroxybenzoic acid derivatives detected in mature vegetables were also detected in our five Brassica species microgreens. However, our five Brassica species microgreens contained a greater variety and higher concentrations of cinamic acids than their mature leaf counterpart. The retention times, HRMS molecular ions [M-H]-, diagnostic MS2 and MS3 product ions, UV lambdamax and identification of the hydroxycinnamates, arranged by molecular weight, are listed in Table 3. Their peaks are eluted with the flavanol glycoside peaks, as shown in Figure 3. The hydroxycinnamic acids, hydoxycinnamoylquinic acids, hydroxycinnamoylmalic acids, and hydroxycinnamoyl saccharides with one to three glucosides were identified using reference compounds (designated by **) or from the literature (designated by *) Table 3. Sixteen of the hydroxycinnamoylsaccharides were formed from di- or triglucoses, mainly gentiobiose, with one to three hydroxycinnamoyl units. By direct comparison with reference compounds in mustard greens, peaks a36, a41, b28 and d26 (Figure 3) were identified as disinapoylgentiobioses. Peaks a4, b11, and c12 were identified as feruloyl-glucosides. Peaks a42, d27, and a43 were identified as sinapoyl-feuloylgentiobioses. Peak a47 and b30, identified as trisinapoylgentionbiose and feruloyl-disinapoyl-gentionbiose, are peaks common to microgreens of mizuna, purple kohlrabi, red mustard, and purple mustard. Peak d11 is only found in mizuna and was tentatively identified as sinapic acid-glucose.Other organic acids, such as caffeoylquinic acid, ferulic acid, sinapic acid, citric acid, malic acid, and caffeoylquinic acid are organic acids common in these five microgreens. There were a number of organic acid isomers found in the five Brassisa microgreens and identification was based on their similar MS2 and MS3 spectra. However, they exhibited different retention times based on species. For example, the peaks a42, a43and d27 all had the same [M-H]- at m/z 723. HRMS measurements suggested the formula of C33H39O18, with the main MS2 product ion at m/z 529 (M - 194, neutral loss of ferulic acid) and the main MS3 product ions at m/z 223 sinapic acid). These compounds were identified as sinapoyl-ferulic acid and its isomers. Similarly, peaks a36, b28, and a41 ([M - H]- at m/z 753, with a main MS2 product ion at 529 and main MS3 product ions at 205) was identified as disinapoylgentiobiose and its isomers.In summary, this is the first study characterizing phenolic profiles specifically in Brassisca species microgreens. A total of 165 phenolic compounds were tentatively identified using complementary information from UHPLC-PDA-HRMSn in negative and positive modes, revealing a large number of highly glycosylated and acylated quercetin, kaempferol, cyanidin aglycones and complex hydroxycinnamic and benzoic acids. The results showed that the Brassica species microgreens tended to have more complex polyphenols profiles and to contain more varieties of polyphenols compared to their mature plant counterpart. Thus, Brassica species microgreens could be considered a good source for polyphenols. This compositional study should serve as reference base for these five Brassica species microgreens and enhance their value to health agencies and consumers"}, "24893216": {"doi": "10.1021/jf405538d", "title": "Profiling of Glucosinolates and Flavonoids in Rorippa indica (Linn.) Hiern. (Cruciferae) by UHPLC-PDA-ESI/HRMSn", "abstract": "An UHPLC-PDA-ESI/HRMSn profiling method was used to identify the glucosinolates and flavonoids of Rorippa indica (Cruciferae), a wild vegetable and Chinese herb used to treat cough, diarrhea, and rheumatoid arthritis. Thirty-three glucosinolates, more than 40 flavonol glycosides, and 18 other phenolic and common organic compounds were identified. The glucosinolates and polyphenols were separated by UHPLC. High-resolution deprotonated molecules provided high accuracy mass values that were used to determine formulas and provide putative identification of the glucosinolates and flavonoids. The fragments from multistage mass spectrometry were used to elucidate the structures. The concentrations of the main components were based on UV peak areas and molar relative response factors with a single calibration standard. This study found this plant to be a rich source for glucosinolates, containing 24 new glucosinolates, including 14 glucosylated glucosinolates that were previously unidentified.", "intro": "IntroductionGlucosinolates (GSs) are sulfur- and nitrogen-containing secondary metabolites found in cruciferous plants. A central carbon is connected to a thioglucose, to a sulfate via a nitrogen atom, and to a side chain (R) (Figure 1). The side chain determines whether the glucosinolate is defined as aliphatic (straight- or branched-chain alkyl, alkenyl, and oxo-, hydroxyl forms), aromatic, or indole. Many glucosinolates also contain one or two more sulfur atoms in the side chain to form another sulfur-containing unit, such as methyl-thio- (-S-), methyl-sulfinyl- (-SO-), methyl- or benzyl-sulfonyl- (-SO2-), mercapto- (HS-), glucosyl-disulfanyl (-S-S-), and cysteinyl-thio- [HOOC-CH(NH2)-CH2-S-]. The glucosinolates and their enzyme-hydrolyzed products (thiocyanates, isothiocyanates, and nitriles) have shown important human health benefits, especially with respect to cancer prevention. Thus, many studies have been carried out on the isolation and structural elucidation of glucosinolates and their hydrolyzed products with respect to their biological activities and distribution in the plant kingdom.-To date, approximately 200 glucosinolates have been reported in plants. An electronic database of the structures, formulas, and accurate masses of 200 knownn and a further 180 predictedn GSs has been established. Desulfoglucosinolates, glucosinolate-related nitriles, and isothiocyanates (Figure 1) formed by the loss of SO3 or other functional groups through the action of sulfatase and myrosinase have been isolated from plants. Glucosinolates, widely distributed in many plants of the Cruciferae family, have also been found in plants from other familiesn although at significantly reduced levels. The glucosinolate profiles of many foods derived from cruciferous plants have been studied qualitatively and quantitatively to establish their dietary intake and relationship to health outcomes in biological, epidemiological, and clinical studies.-The fragmentation patterns of glucosinolates have been studied using multistage mass spectrometry (MSn), primarily in the negative ionization mode. High-performance liquid chromatography and MSn with electrospray ionization (HPLC-ESI/MSn) has been widely used to identify the intact glucosinolate components of plants.- Most glucosinolates have an ultraviolet (UV) absorbance maximum wavelength (lambdamax) between 219 and 228 nm. They can be quantified directly from the UV absorbance at 225 nm when they are well separated. However, in most cases, quantification has been based on absorbance of the desulfoglucosinolates following sulfatase hydrolysis. Quantification is based on calibration with a single compound and predetermined relative response factors (RRFs).-Rorippa indica (Linn.) Hiern. is a perennial plant of the Cruciferae family that is widely distributed throughout the world. Its fresh spear-shaped leaves and tender seedlings are used as a healthy food, and the whole plant is used as an animal feed in China. The dried whole plant material is used as a Chinese traditional herb with purported diuretic, anti-inflammatory, antifever, and anticough properties and to help with blood circulation and rheumatoid arthritis. Some glucosinolates have been reported in R. indica and several other Rorippa plants. Ronifore (9-methylsulfonylnonyl nitrile) and its related amide (rorifamide) were isolated as the anticough components of Rorippa montana. Fifteen isothiocyanates and desulfoglucosinolates were isolated from the roots of Rorippa plants, and several flavonol glycosides, phenolic acids, and derivatives, and other organic compounds have been reported.- This paper presents a comprehensive study of the glucosinolate and polyphenolic components of R. indica.Phenolic compounds are widely distributed in plant-derived foods, whereas the glucosinolates are among the biologically active components of Cruciferous plants. Both types of compounds are known to have many potential benefits to human health. As a part of our project to systematically identify and quantify these compounds, both standardized HPLC-PDA-ESI/MS and UHPLC-PDA-ESI/HRMSn methods were developed to identify and quantify the phenolics using their molar relative response factors (MRRFs) for UV absorbance.- In this study, the UHPLC-PDA-ESI/HRMSn method was used to analyze the phenolic and glucosinolate profiles of R. indica and led to the identification of 33 glucosinolates, including 24 for the first time, and more than 40 flavonol glycosides. This study found that R. indica was a rich plant source for glucosinolates on the basis of its structural variety and total concentration of glucosinolates.", "results": "Results and DiscussionIdentification of GlucosinolatesThirty-three glucosinolates were detected in the plant extract. Figure 1 lists the identification codes, putative identification, retention times (recorded on the TIC chromatogram), deprotonated molecule high-resolution mass, formula, error between the experimental and calculated values, and main and important fragments from MS2, MS3, and MS4 fragmentations for each peak. The listing is in order of molecular weight. The TIC and PDA (at 225 nm) chromatograms are shown in Figure 2. Thirty-three of the compounds were putatively identified, and nine compounds could not be identified.The main glucosinolates of this plant consisted of methylsulfonyl straight alkyl chain compounds (CH3S(O)2(CH2)n) (Figure 1). The most concentrated glucosinolate (GS-1) had TIC and UV peaks with retention times (tR) at 18.88 and 18.83 min (Figure 2), UV lambdamax at 225 nm, and a [M - H]- of 522.1134 Da for C17H32O11NS3 (calcd 522.1129 Da, with the error of -1.72 ppm) for 9-(methylsulfonyl)nonylglucosinolate (GS-1). The assignment of this compound as 9-(methylsulfonyl)nonyl glucosinolate (GS-1) was based on the fact that the hydrolyzed products, desulfoglucosinolate, isothiocynate, and nitrile (rofifone), had been previously isolated from this plant. Furthermore, the authors in China isolated the related nitrile from the same plant material and confirmed the structure by nuclear magnetic resonance.GS-1 had major MS2 fragments at m/z 291 (100%, [C6H11O9S2]-), 275 (28%, [C6H11O8S2]-), and 259 (73%, [C6H11O9S]-), ions a, c, and b in Figures 3 and 4A. MS3 had a major fragment at m/z 97 (100%, [HSO4]-), ion d in Figure 4B. The compositions for ions a, c, and b were confirmed by the experimentally determined masses of 290.9842 (error -2.7 ppm), 274.9890 (error -3.9 ppm), and 259.0117 (error -4.8 ppm, Figure 3), respectively, from the additional data-dependent scan with activation in HCD.Figure 3 illustrates the fragmentation pathway leading to the four product ions through the loss of RCN and RNCS groups. Some glucosinolates, such as 4-methoxyglucobrassin, glucobrassicin, 3'-hydroxyglucoisatisin, glucoisatinsin, and sinalbin, were reported to present an MS2 fragment (b, 291 Da) with a relative intensity of 6-61%. These diagnostic ions fully supported the identification of this compound as a glucosinolate.Two minor peaks (GS-2 and GS-3, tR = 10.39 and 21.00 min) had the same high-resolution deprotonated molecular ion masses as GS-1 and similar MS2 and MS3 fragments. Thus, they were determined to be isomers of GS-1. Most likely, the R groups are isomeric.Three glucosinolates, GS4, GS-5, and GS-6, are analogues of GS-1 and identified as 7-methylsulfonylheptyl- (tR = 6.67 min, [M - H]- = 494.0823 Da), 8-(methylsulfonyl)octyl- (tR = 12.24 min, [M - H]- = 508.0978 Da), and 10-methylsulfonyldecylglucosinolates (tR = 27.25 min, [M - H]- = 536.1301 Da), respectively. Their mass differences arise from the numbers of CH2 units. Their retention times correlate with increasing mass, suggesting that the R groups are straight chains and the increasing number results in increased retention times as the polarity decreases. These data also confirmed the identification of these compounds as glucosinolates.Four other glucosinolates (GS-7-GS-10) containing methylsulfinyl (CH3SO(CH2)n) were detected. They were putatively identified as 8-(methylsulfinyl)octyl- (tR = 11.39 time, [M - H]- = 492.1031 Da), 9-(methylsulfinyl)nonyl- (tR = 17.66 and 18.71 min, [M - H]- close to 506.1189 Da, two isomers, GS-8 and GS-9), and 10-(methylsulfinyl)decyl glucosinolates (tR = 25.28 min, [M - H]- = 520.1347 Da), respectively. All of them showed the same diagnostic fragments, confirming them as glucosinolates, and their elution time increased with increasing numbers of CH2 units.GS-11 (tR = 11.85 min) contained an indole function and was putatively identified as 4-methoxyindol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate on the basis of its high-resolution mass value of 477.0635 Da. This compound showed the same fragmentation behavior observed above. Eight of the above glucosinolates (GS-1, GS-4, GS-5, GS-6, GS-7, GS-8, GS-10, and GS-11) were previously reported, and GS-7, GS-8, and GS-11 were found in Rorippa plants. Furthermore, the desulfoglucosinolates and/or isothiocyanates of the above glucosinolates (except GS-4) were previously isolated from the roots of this plant. However, compounds GS-2, GS-3, and GS-9 were not known glucosinolates.-The remaining 21 peaks were putatively identified as glucosinolates and will be discussed in detail. GS-12 (tR = 33.33 min, [M - H]- = 488.1622 Da) had a deprotonated molecular ion of C18H34O10NS2 (error 0.49 ppm) and showed the classic glucosinolate MS2 fragments at m/z 259 (100%), 275 (44%), and 291 (33%). After subtraction of ion b (m/z 259, C6H11O9S) or ion a (m/z 291, C6H11O9S2) from the deprotonated molecule (Figure 3), the masses for R-NCS or R-CN were obtained. Each showed a formula for R = HO-(CH2)11, that is, C11H23O, the same as that obtained directly from R = C18H34O10NS2 - C7H11O9NS2 (Figure 3). In this way, the structures for the glucosinolates can be figured out easily. Thus, this compound was putatively identified as hydroxyundecyl glucosinolate. This glucosinolate was not among the predicted 180 new glucosinolates in the electronic database of Clarke because the number of CH2 groups (n) is 11 and 10 was the largest considered in the prediction set.Two groups of the isomeric alkyl glucosinolates were observed. The first group (GS-13-GS-16) contained four isomers (tR = 5.41, 6.47, 7.74, and 10.55 min, [M - H]- = 538.1081 Da). They showed product ions of m/z 291, 275, 259, and 97 and were identified as 9-(methylsulfonyl)hydroxynonylglucosinolates. They had one more hydroxyl group than that of related 9-(methylsulfonyl)nonylglucosinolate (GS-1) and its isomers (GS-2 and GS-3). The second group (GS-17 and GS-18) consisted of two isomers (tR = 10.97 and 13.34 min, [M - H]- = 552.1236 Da). They showed the same diagnostic GS fragments and were putatively identified as 10-methylsulfonylhydroxydecylglucosinolates and to be the hydroxyl derivatives of 10-methylsulfonyldecylglucosinolate (GS-6) and its isomers. The R groups for the isomers can be determined in the same manner as described previously for GS-12. Among them, GS-13 and GS-17 (with suggested straight chains for the R group) were among the predicted 180 new glucosinolates in the electronic database of Clarke with code numbers 245 and 246, respectively.Four minor peaks (GS-19-GS-22) had different retention times (tR = 17.68, 16.08, 16.84, and 20.92 min) but a similar mass ([M - H]- = 684.1658-684.1663 Da) corresponding to a formula of C23H42O16NS3 (errors less than -2.0 ppm). GS-19 had major MS2 fragments at m/z 522 (77%, [M - H] - 162, loss of glucosyl), 453 (100%, 291 + 162, ion ag, the \"g\" means the fragment contained a glucosyl, C6H10O5, Figure 3), 437 (23%, 275 + 162, ion cg), 421 (94%, 259 + 162, ion bg, Figure 3), and 259 (14%, ion b) (Figures 4 and 5 and Table 1). The detection of ions a, b, and c plus a glucosyl is reasonable, and [M - H]- = 421.0670 (error of 3.0 ppm) for ion b confirmed its composition as C12H21O14S. Thus, the data suggest that these compounds are the glucosides of 9-(methylsulfonyl)nonyl glucosinolate (the glucoside of GS-1).GS-20, GS-21, and GS-22 also showed the typical glucosinolate glucoside fragments at m/z 453, 437, and 421 (Figures 3 and 5 and Table 1). On the basis of both of the high-resolution mass values and the presence of the gluocosinolate glucoside characteristic fragments, they were identified as the glucosides of 9-(methylsulfonyl)nonylglucosinolates (the glucosides of GS-1-GS-3). Because there was no hydroxyl function on the R group, this glucosyl was most likely connected to the thioglucoside and most likely at the 6-position as that for a monoacylated glucosinolate.Similarly, four other compounds (GS-23-GS-26) were recognized as the glucosides of glucosinolates on the basis of the fact that they presented the same diagnostic fragments at m/z 453, 437, and 421. GS-23 (tR = 22.55 min, [M - H]- = 654.1554 Da, C22H40O15NS3, error less than -2 ppm) was putatively identified as a glucoside of 9-(methylsulfinyl)nonylglucosinolate (the glucoside of GS-8). GS-24-GS-26 (tR = 23.37, 24.29, and 28.18 min, [M - H]- = 698.1915 Da, C24H44O16NS3, error -1.8 ppm) were putatively identified as the glucosides of 10-methylsulfonyldecylglucosinolates (the glucosides of GS-6 and its isomers).One pair of isomers, GS-27 and GS-28 (tR = 16.43 and 18.58 min, [M - H]- = 668.1712 Da, C23H42O15NS3, error -1.5 ppm) were putatively identified as glucosides of 9-(methylsulfinyl)nonylglucosinolate (the glucosides of GS-5 or its isomer). GS-29 (tR = 22.79 min, [M - H]- = 682.1868 Da, C23H44O15NS3, error -1.5 ppm) was thought to be the glucoside of 10-(methylsulfinyl)decylglucosinolate (the glucosides of GS-10 or its isomer). The base MS2 fragments (m/z 604 for GS-27 and GS-28 and m/z 618 for GS-29) showed a loss of 64 Da (loss of CH3 - SO - H), indicating that these glucosinolates contained a methylsulfinyl (CH3-SO-) group in the side chain. Both GS-27and GS-28 had MS3 spectra containing the diagnostic gucosinolate glucoside fragments at m/z 453 (25 and 28%, respectively), 437 (100 and 56%), and 421 (both 100%) to confirm their identification. Similar fragments were not observed for GS-29. However, the MS2 signal was very weak.Four other compounds (GS-30-GS-33) also appeared to be analogues of the glucosides of glucosinolates on the basis of their masses and formulas. GS-30 (tR = 28.07 min, [M - H]- = 622.1290 Da, C21H36O14NS3, error -0.5 ppm) might be the glucoside of methylthioethenylpentenyl (CH3:S:C=C(CH2)5) or an isomer of methylthioheptenyl. The aglycone with a methylthioethenylpentenyl group is among the 180 predicted new glucosinolates (no. 204) in the electronic database of Clarke.GS-31 and GS-32 (tR = 22.16 and 21.15 min) have the same nominal masses, but have different high-accuracy masses. GS-31 ([M - H]- = 638.1245 Da, C21H36O15NS3, error -1.2 ppm) was putatively identified as the glucoside of 7-methylthio-3-oxoheptylglucosinolate or 7-methylsulfinylheptenylglucosinolate. GS-32 ([M - H]- = 638.1608 Da, C22H40O14NS3, error -1.3 ppm) might be the glucoside of 8-methylthiooctylglucosinolate.GS-33 (tR = 16.51 min, [M - H]- = 640.1403 Da, C21H38O15NS3, error -0.9 ppm) might be the glucoside of 7-(methylsulfinyl)heptyl glucosinolate. Instead of showing the typical glucosinolate glucoside fragment described above, three of them (GS-31-GS-33) had base MS2 or MS3 fragments at m/z 391 like GS-23. Consequently, the lack of definitive MS2 fragments made it impossible to develop a molecular formula for this ion. The putative formula offered in Table 1 was based primarily on the close match of the experimentally measured high-resolution masses with calculated values. The aglycones of these three glucosides were known glucosinolates, but not detected in this plant.The 14 glucosinolate glucosides mentioned above have not been previously reported in any other plants. They represent a new family of glucosinolates with a glucosyl connected to the thioglucosyl group. All of the observed MSn fragments could be related to the structural elements of the glucosinolate skeleton. For examples, ions a, b, c, and d and thioglucosyl (m/z 195), as well as fragments obtained from further losses of oxygen, sulfur, or parts of the glucosyl were observed. However, not enough fragments were obtained to determine the structure of the R groups.- Of course, the R groups for the glucosinolates were not very large (containing fewer than 12 carbon atoms for the aliphatic GSs), but they can be arranged in several different ways to form the isomers. For example, the aliphatic structure can be linear or branched, the oxygen atom can be found in the oxo (keto) or hydroxy form, and the alkenyl double bond can be located at different positions.- As a result, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis is still the most accurate way to identify GSs structurally.The major glucosinolates of R. montana had similar side chains and were well separated, allowing for the measurement of their peak areas at 225 nm (Figure 3). Their concentrations were calculated relative to glucocheirolin using MRRF values of 1.0, on the basis of previous reports that the side chains were similar and did not alter the absorption coefficient of the molecules. The relative peak area ratios for GS-1, GS-8, GS-6, GS-5, and GS-10 were 100.0, 15.5, 9.6, 5.1, and 4.6, respectively. The corresponding concentrations for GS-1, GS-8, GS-6, GS-5, and GS-10 were 0.51, 0.079, 0.049, 0.026, and 0.024% on a dry weight basis, and their total contents was 0.69% or 690 mg/100 g of dried plant materials. GS-1 constituted approximately 71% of the total glucosinolate content.Identification of Phenolic and Other Common CompoundsTable 2 presents the retention times (recorded on the TIC chromatograms), HR masses, and formulas for deprotonated molecules [M - H]-, diagnostic MS2, MS3, MS4, and MS5 product ions, and putative identities of 44 flavonol glycoside, 18 phenolic, and other common compounds. The listing is in order of molecular weight. The typical TIC and PDA (at 354 nm) chromatograms are shown in Figure 2. The strategy for identifying phenolic compounds in food samples has been described previously. In this study, only the glycosides of flavonols were observed, and most are reported for the first time.Two tetrahydroxyflavone 3-O-rhamnosylhexosides (tR = 28.22 and 26.52 min, [M - H]- = 593.1491) provided the largest peaks (F-1 and F-2 in Figure 2A) in chromatograms of the R. indica extract. They had UV band I maximum absorbances at 265 and 346 nm and base MS2 and MS3 fragments of m/z 447 (by loss of 146) and m/z 284 (the radical anion species of kaempferol from the loss of 162 + 1 rather than the ion at m/z 285), suggesting that they might be kaempferol glycosides containing a rhamnosylhexose. This radical anion had base MS4 and MS5 fragments of m/z 255 (100%) and 221(100%), which suggested that this flavonol was most likely to be kaempferol. This identification was confirmed by the fact that kaempferol was the tetrahydroxyflavone (by direct comparison with kaempferol standards) in the acidic hydrolyzed extract (chromatogram not shown). The close retention times of the flavonol glycoside suggested that they might be kaempferol 3-O-rhamnosylglucosides with the rhamnosyl at the 6-position of hexosyl (glucosyl or galactosyl). Their high-resolution mass confirmed their putative identification.Four other peaks with different retention times (tR = 17.35, 21.04, 30.80, and 32.13 min) had high-resolution masses close to 593.1500 Da, and all had similar fragments, suggesting they were also kaempferol rhamnosylhexosides. However, they were all minor components of the plant and did not provide sufficient UV data or MSn fragments to allow identification of a specific isomeric structure. Thus, their position of attachment to the flavone and the type of hexose were not completely identified.Similarly, flavonoid F-3 (tR = 24.61 min, [M - H]- = 609.1470 Da) had a MS2 fragment at m/z 447 (loss of 162) and an MS3 fragment at m/z 301 (loss of 146) and was putatively identified as quercetin 3-O-hexosylrhamnoside. Its isomers (tR = 23.42 and 25.84 min) had MS2 fragments at m/z 463 (loss of 146) and MS3 fragments at m/z 301 (loss of 162), suggesting they were quercetin 3-rhamnosylhexosides. The isomer with tR = 23.42 min was further identified as rutin by direct comparison with an authentic standard. Another isomer (tR = 34.50 min) had a MS2 fragment at m/z 301, and its sugar connection could not be determined. The MS4 and MS5 fragments for m/z 301 were 255 (22-27%), 179 (41-71%), 151 (100%), and 107 (100) and suggested the aglycone was quercetin. This was confirmed by the fact that the pentahydroxyflavone in the acidic hydrolyzed extract was identified as quercetin.One flavonoid (tR = 30.31 min, [M - H]- = 623.1611 Da) had a base MS2 fragment at m/z 477, a base MS3 fragment at m/z 314, and MS4 and MS5 ions at m/z 285 and 270 to suggest it was isorhamnetin 3-O-rhamnosylhexoside. Two rhamnosides and three hexosides of kaempferol were detected. At least one of the rhamnosides and hexosides might have the glycosyl at the 3-position of kaempferol. Another flavonoid (tR = 33.59 min, [M - H]- = 577.1555 Da, C27H29O14) had a base MS2 fragment at m/z 431 and a base MS3 fragment at m/z 285 to suggest it was kaempferol 3-O-rhamnosylrhamnoside.Similarly, six flavonoids conjugated with three monosaccharides were putatively identified. The first two flavonoids (tR = 34.46 and 33.19 min, C32H37O18) showed one pentosyl more than that of kaempferol 3-O-rhamnosylrhamnoside. The first one (F-6) had a base MS2 fragment at m/z 563 (loss of 146 Da) and a base MS3 fragment at m/z 284 (loss of 278 Da, i.e., 146 + 132) to indicate it was kaempferol 3-O-rhamnosylpentosylrhamnoside. The second one (tR = 33.19) was very similar to F-6 but had a base MS2 fragment at m/z 447 (loss of 294 Da) for a dirhamnosylpentoside. Another three flavonoids (tR = 34.46, 33.19, 24.73, 26.21, and 27.94 min, C33H39O20) had base MS2 fragments at m/z 609 Da (loss of 146 Da), a base MS3 fragment at m/z 285 Da (loss of 324 Da), and a base MS4 fragment at m/z 151, suggesting them to be isomers of kaempferol 3-O-rhamnosyldihexosides. The last flavonoid (tR = 22.95 min [M - H]- = 771.1971 Da, C33H39O21) had a base MS2 fragment at m/z 625 (loss of 146 Da), indicating it might be quercetin 3-O-rhamnosyldihexoside.Acylation of the flavonol glycosides was determined by mass difference. An increased mass close to 146.0366, 162.0315, 176.0471, or 206.0576 Da was diagnostic of the presence of a p-coumaroyl, caffeoyl, feruloyl, or sinapoyl group. For example, two kaempferol acylglyocosides (tR = 37.65 and 39.03 min, [M - H]- close to 755.1826 Da, C36H35O18) had a base MS2 fragment at m/z 609 Da (calculated as 609.1460, with error of -0.177 ppm for C27H29O16, from loss of 146.0366 Da, C9H6O2 for coumaroyl, instead of loss of 146.0576 Da, C6H10O4, rhamnosyl) and base MS3,4 fragments (m/z 447, 285, 257, 241, 229, 151 Da) identifying them as kaempferol 3-O-p-coumaroyldihexosides. Similarly, three acylated flavonoids (tR = 30.24, 42.70, and 46.66 min, [M - H]- close to 769.1975 Da, C37H37O18) had base MS2 fragments at m/z 575 (loss of around 194.0576 Da for C10H10O4, ferulic acid) suggesting they were kaempferol 3-O- feruloylrhamnosylhexosides. In the same way, four acylated glycosides were putatively identified as the 3-O-caffoeyldihexoside (tR = 31.67 min, [M - H]- = 771.1797 Da), the 3-O-sinapoyldihexoside (tR = 41.60 min, [M - H]- = 831.1974 Da), the 3-O-hexoside-7-O-methoxybenzoyldihexoside (tR = 33.57 min, [M - H]- = 921.2290 Da), and the 3-O-sinapoylhydroxyferuoyldihexoside-7-O-hexoside (tR = 39.84 min, [M - H]- = 1185.2914 Da) of quercetin, respectively. In the same manner, the remaining ones were identified as two 3-O-sinapoylhexoside-7-O-rhamnosides (tR = 42.40 and 46.26 min, [M - H]- close to 799.2093 Da), the 3-O-hydroxybenzoyldihexoside-7-O-hexoside (tR = 31.17 min, [M - H]- = 891.2185 Da), the 3- O-caffeoyldihexoside-7-O-rhamnoside (tR = 32.85 min, [M - H]- = 917.2340 Da), the 3-O-feruloyldihexoside-7-O-rhamnosides (tR = 34.95 and 38.95 min, [M - H]- = 931.2504 Da), two 3-O-sinapoyldihexoside-7-O-rhamnosides (tR = 34.46 min, [M - H]- = 961.2604 Da), and the 3-O-acetylhexosylrhamnoside (tR = 31.43 min, [M - H]- = 635.1605 Da) of kaempferol, respectively.As mentioned in a previous publication, dried rutin (at 354 nm) was used as the quantification standard and the MRRF values of two main flavonoids were used to determine their concentrations. Concentrations of approximately 0.05 and 0.01% (or 50 and 10 mg/100 g of plant material on dry weight basis) were obtained for flavonoids F1 and F2, respectively. The total flavonoid content of this plant is <0.10% because the remaining flavonols were present at very low concentrations and UV peaks were not detectable for absorbance measurements.In addition to the flavonoids, 1 lignan (lariciresinol 4-O-beta-d-glucopyranoside) and 18 other common compounds, including the glucosides of hydroxybenzoic and hydroxycinnamic acids and their derivatives (e.g., bound to sugar, quinic acid, and malic acid) and organic acids, were identified by comparison of the chromatographic and MS data with those in our in-house flavonoid database. Most of the common compounds have previously been detected in other plants analyzed in this laboratory.The results of this study showed that R. indica is a rich source of glucosinolates.- These compounds were reasonably separated using the UHPLC conditions described here and identified by their high-accuracy mass measurement and multistage mass fragments. The UV absorbance of the major glucosinolates was used to compute their concentration. In summary, 33 glucosinolates, over 40 flavonoids, and more than 20 other phenolic and organic compounds were identified.This research is supported by the Agriculture Research Service of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and an Interagency Agreement with the Office of Dietary Supplements of the National Institutes of Health.The authors declare no competing financial interest."}}
